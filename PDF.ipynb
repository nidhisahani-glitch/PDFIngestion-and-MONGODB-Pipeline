Unfortunately, we have\\npractically no accounts of travel left by women, though\\nwe know that they travelled.\\nThe accounts that survive are often varied in terms of\\ntheir subject matter. Some deal with affairs of the court,\\nwhile others are mainly focused on religious issues, or\\narchitectural features and monuments.

It is this difference in\\nperspective that makes the accounts of travellers\\ninteresting. Who did these travellers write for? As\\nwe will see, the answers vary from one instance\\nto the next.\\n1. Al-Biruni and t he\\nKitab-ul-Hind\\n1.1 From Khwarizm to the Punjab\\nAl-Biruni was born in 973, in Khwarizm in present-\\nday Uzbekistan. Khwarizm was an important centre\\nof learning, and Al-Biruni received the best\\neducation available at the time. He was well versed\\nin several languages: Syriac, Arabic, Persian,\\nHebrew and Sanskrit. Although he did not know\\nGreek, he was familiar with the works of Plato\\nand other Greek philosophers, having read\\nthem  in Arabic translations. In 1017, when Sultan\\nMahmud invaded Khwarizm,  he took several\\nscholars and poets back to his capital, Ghazni;\\nAl-Biruni was one of them. He arrived in Ghazni as\\na hostage, but gradually developed a liking for the\\ncity, where he spent the rest of his life until his\\ndeath at the age of 70.\\nIt was in Ghazni that Al-Biruni developed an\\ninterest in India. This was not unusual. Sanskrit\\nworks on astronomy, mathematics and medicine had\\nbeen translated into Arabic from the eighth century\\nonwards. When the Punjab became a part of the\\nGhaznavid empire, contacts with the local population\\nhelped create an environment of mutual trust and\\nunderstanding. Al-Biruni spent years in the company\\nof Brahmana priests and scholars, learning Sanskrit,\\nand studying religious and philosophical texts. While\\nhis itinerary is not clear, it is likely that he travelled\\nwidely in the Punjab and parts of northern India.\\nTravel literature was already an accepted part of\\nArabic literature by the time he wrote. This literature\\ndealt with lands as far apart as the Sahara desert\\nin the west to the River Volga in the north. So, whileTranslating te xts,\\nsharing ideas\\nAl-Biruni’s expertise in several\\nlanguages allowed him to\\ncompare languages and\\ntranslate texts. He translated\\nseveral Sanskrit works, including\\nPatanjali’s work on grammar ,\\ninto Arabic. For his Brahmana\\nfriends, he translated the\\nworks of Euclid (a Greek\\nmathematician) into Sanskrit.Al-Biruni’s objectives\\nAl-Biruni described his work as:\\na help to those who want to\\ndiscuss religious questions\\nwith them (the Hindus), and\\nas a repertory of information\\nto those who want to\\nassociate with them.Source 1\\n/circleright Read the excerpt from\\nAl-Biruni (Source 5) and\\ndiscuss whether his work\\nmet these objectives.\\n2024-25\\n117\\nfew people in India would have read Al-Biruni before\\n1500, many others outside India may have done so.\\n1.2 The  Kitab-ul-Hind\\nAl-Biruni’s Kitab-ul-Hind, written in Arabic, is simple\\nand lucid. It is a voluminous text, divided into\\n80 chapters on subjects such as religion and\\nphilosophy, festivals, astronomy, alchemy, manners\\nand customs, social life, weights and measures,\\niconography, laws and  metrology.\\nGenerally (though not always), Al-Biruni adopted\\na distinctive structure in each chapter, beginning\\nwith a question, following this up with a description\\nbased on Sanskritic traditions, and concluding\\nwith a comparison with other cultures. Some\\npresent-day scholars have argued that this almost\\ngeometric structure, remarkable for its precision and\\npredictability, owed much to his mathematica l\\norientation.\\nAl-Biruni, who wrote in Arabic, probably intended\\nhis work for peoples living along the frontiers of the\\nsubcontinent. He was familiar with translations\\nand adaptations of Sanskrit, Pali and Prakrit texts\\ninto Arabic – these ranged from fables to works on\\nastronomy and medicine. However, he was also\\ncritical about the ways in which these texts were\\nwritten, and clearly wanted to improve on them.THROUGH  THE EYES OF TRAVELLERS\\nMetrology  is the science of\\nmeasurement.\\nHindu\\nThe term “Hindu” was derived\\nfrom an Old Persian word,\\nused c. sixth-fifth centuries\\nBCE, to refer to the region east\\nof the river Sindhu (Indus).\\nThe Arabs continued the\\nPersian usage and called this\\nregion “al-Hind” and its\\npeople “Hindi”.

Ibn Battut a’s Rihla\\n2.1 An early globe-trotter\\nIbn Battuta’s book of travels, called Rihla,  written in\\nArabic, provides extremely rich and interesting\\ndetails about the social and cultural life in the\\nsubcontinent in the fourteenth century. This\\nMoroccan traveller was born in Tangier into one of\\nthe most respectable and educated families known\\nfor their expertise in Islamic religious law or shari‘a.\\nTrue to the tradition of his family, Ibn Battuta\\nreceived literary and scholastic education when he\\nwas quite young.\\nUnlike most other members of his class, Ibn\\nBattuta considered experience gained through travels\\nto be a more important source of knowledge than\\nbooks. He just loved travelling, and went to far-off\\nplaces, exploring new worlds and peoples. Before he\\nset off for India in 1332-33, he had made pilgrimage\\ntrips to Mecca, and had already travelled extensively\\nin Syria, Iraq, Persia, Yemen, Oman and a few\\ntrading ports on the coast of East Africa.\\nTravelling overland through Central Asia, Ibn\\nBattuta reached Sind in 1333. He had heard\\nabout Muhammad bin Tughlaq, the Sultan of Delhi,\\nand lured by his reputation as a generous patron\\nof arts and letters, set off for Delhi, passing through\\nMultan and Uch. The Sultan was impressed by\\nhis scholarship, and appointed him the qazi  or judge\\nof Delhi. He remained in that position for several\\nyears, until he fell out of favour and was thrown\\ninto prison. Once the misunderstanding between\\nhim and the Sultan was cleared, he was\\nrestored to imperial service, and was\\nordered in 1342 to proceed to China as the\\nSultan’s envoy to the Mongol ruler.\\nWith the new assignment, Ibn Battuta\\nproceeded to the Malabar coast through\\ncentral India. From Malabar he went to\\nthe Maldives, where he stayed for eighteen\\nmonths as the qazi, but eventually decided\\nto proceed to Sri Lanka. He then went back\\nonce more to the Malabar coast and the\\nMaldives, and before resuming his mission\\nto China, visited Bengal and Assam as well.\\nHe took a ship to Sumatra, and from there\\nanother ship for the Chinese port town ofSource 2\\nFig. 5.3\\nRobbers attacking travellers, a\\nsixteenth-century Mughal painting\\n/circleright How can you distinguish the\\ntravellers from the robbers?The bird leaves its nest\\nThis is an excerpt from the Rihla:\\nMy departur e from T angier ,\\nmy birthplace, took place on\\nThursday ...

According to Ibn Battuta, it took forty days\\nto travel from Multan to Delhi and about fifty days\\nfrom Sind to Delhi.

François Bernier\\nA Doctor with a Difference\\nOnce the Portuguese arrived in India in about 1500,\\na number of them wrote detailed accounts regarding\\nIndian social customs and religious practices. A few\\nof them, such as the Jesuit Roberto Nobili, even\\ntranslated Indian texts into European languages.\\nAmong the best known of the Portuguese writers\\nis Duarte Barbosa, who wrote a detailed account of\\ntrade and society in south India. Later, after 1600,\\nwe find growing numbers of Dutch, English and\\nFrench travellers coming to India. One of the most\\nfamous was the French jeweller Jean-Baptiste\\nTavernier, who travelled to India at least six times.\\nHe was particularly fascinated with the trading\\nconditions in India, and compared India to Iran and\\nthe Ottoman empire. Some of these travellers, like\\nthe Italian doctor Manucci, never returned to Europe,\\nand settled down in India.\\nFrançois Bernier, a Frenchman, was a doctor,\\npolitical philosopher and historian. Like many\\nothers, he came to the Mughal Empire in search of\\nopportunities. He was in India for twelve years, from\\n1656 to 1668, and was closely associated with the\\nMughal court, as a physician to Prince Dara Shukoh,\\nthe eldest son of Emperor Shah Jahan, and later as\\nan intellectual and scientist, with Danishmand\\nKhan, an Armenian noble at the Mughal court.\\n3.1 Comparing “East” and “West”\\nBernier travelled to several parts of the country, and\\nwrote accounts of what he saw, frequently comparing\\nwhat he saw in India with the situation in Europe.\\nHe dedicated his major writing to Louis XIV, the\\nking of France, and many of his other works were\\nwritten in the form of letters to influential officials\\nand ministers. In virtually every instance Bernier\\ndescribed what he saw in India as a bleak situation\\nin comparison to developments in Europe. As we\\nwill see, this assessment was not always accurate.\\nHowever, when his works were published, Bernier’s\\nwritings became extremely popular.Fig. 5.6\\nA seventeenth-century painting\\ndepicting Bernier in European\\nclothes\\nFig. 5.7\\nA painting depicting Tavernier in Indian clothes\\n2024-25\\n123\\nTravelling with the Mughal army\\nBernier often travelled with the army .

Between 1670\\nand 1725 his account was reprinted eight times in\\nFrench, and by 1684 it had been reprinted three\\ntimes in English.

Making Sense of an Alien W orld\\nAl-Biruni and the Sanskritic\\nTradition\\n4.1 Overcoming barriers to understanding\\nAs we have seen, travellers often compared what\\nthey saw in the subcontinent with practices\\nwith which they were familiar. Each traveller\\nadopted  distinct strategies to understand what they\\nobserved.  Al-Biruni, for instance, was aware of the\\nproblems inherent in the task he had set himself.\\nHe discussed several “barriers” that he felt\\nobstructed understanding. The first amongst these\\nwas language. According to him, Sanskrit was so\\ndifferent from Arabic and Persian that ideas and\\nconcepts could not be easily translated from one\\nlanguage into another.\\nThe second barrier he identified was the difference\\nin religious beliefs and practices. The self-absorption\\nand consequent insularity of the local population\\naccording to him, constituted the third barrier.\\nWhat is interesting is that even though he was aware\\nof these problems, Al-Biruni depended almost\\nexclusively on the works of Brahmanas, often citing\\npassages from the Vedas, the Puranas, the Bhagavad\\nGita, the works of Patanjali, the Manusmriti , etc., to\\nprovide an understanding of Indian society.\\n4.2 Al-Biruni’s description of the caste system\\nAl-Biruni tried to explain the caste system by looking\\nfor parallels in other societies. He noted that in\\nancient Persia, four social categories were\\nrecognised: those of knights and princes; monks,\\nfire-priests and lawyers; physicians, astronomers\\nand other scientists; and finally, peasants and\\nartisans. In other words, he attempted to suggest\\nthat social divisions were not unique to India. At\\nthe same time he pointed out that within Islam all\\nmen were considered equal, differing only in their\\nobservance of piety.\\nIn spite of his acceptance of the Brahmanical\\ndescription of the caste system, Al-Biruni disapproved\\nof the notion of pollution. He remarked that\\neverything which falls into a state of impurity strives\\nand succeeds in regaining its original condition of\\npurity. The sun cleanses the air, and the salt in the\\nsea prevents the water from becoming polluted. If itA language with an\\nenormous range\\nAl-Biruni described Sanskrit as\\nfollows:\\nIf you want to conquer this\\ndifficulty (i.e. to learn\\nSanskrit), you will not find\\nit easy , because the\\nlanguage is of an enormous\\nrange, both in words and\\ninflections, something like\\nthe Arabic, calling one and\\nthe same thing by various\\nnames, both original and\\nderivative, and using one\\nand the same word for a\\nvariety of subjects, which,\\nin order to be properly\\nunderstood, must be\\ndistinguished from each\\nother by various qualifying\\nepithets.\\nGod knows best!\\nTravellers did not always believe\\nwhat they were told. When\\nfaced with the story of a wooden\\nidol that supposedly lasted for\\n216,432 years, Al-Biruni asks:\\nHow , then, could wood\\nhave lasted such a length of\\ntime, and particularly in a\\nplace where the air and the\\nsoil are rather wet? God\\nknows best!\\n2024-25\\n125\\nwere not so, insisted Al-Biruni, life on earth would\\nhave been impossible. The conception of social\\npollution, intrinsic to the caste system, was\\naccording to him, contrary to the laws of nature.\\nThe system of varnas\\nThis is Al-Biruni’s account of the system of varnas:\\nThe highest caste are the Brahmana, of whom the\\nbooks of the Hindus tell us that they were created from\\nthe head of Brahman. And as the Brahman is only\\nanother name for the force called nature, and the head\\nis the highest part of the … body , the Brahmana ar e the\\nchoice part of the whole genus. Therefore the Hindus\\nconsider them as the very best of mankind.\\nThe next caste are the Kshatriya, who were created,\\nas they say , from the shoulders and hands of Brahman.\\nTheir degree is not much below that of the Brahmana.\\nAfter them follow the V aishya, who wer e created fr om\\nthe thigh of Brahman.\\nThe Shudra, who were created from his feet . . .\\nBetween the latter two classes there is no very\\ngreat distance. Much, however , as these classes\\ndiffer fr om each other , they live together in the\\nsame towns and villages, mixed together in the same\\nhouses and lodgings.\\nAs we have seen, Al-Biruni’s description of the\\ncaste system was deeply influenced by his study\\nof normative Sanskrit texts which laid down the rules\\ngoverning the system from the point of view of\\nthe Brahmanas. However, in real life the system\\nwas not quite as rigid. For instance, the categories\\ndefined as antyaja (literally, born outside the system)\\nwere often expected to provide inexpensive labour to\\nboth  peasants and zamindars  (see also Chapter 8).\\nIn other words, while they were often subjected to\\nsocial oppression, they were included within\\neconomic networks./circleright Discuss...\\nHow important is knowledge\\nof the language of the area for\\na traveller from a different\\nregion?Source 5\\n/circleright Compare what Al-Biruni\\nwrote with Source 6, Chapter 3.\\nDo you notice any similarities\\nand differences?

As we have seen, Ibn Battuta himself\\ntravelled extensively through these lands, visiting\\nsacred shrines, spending time with learned men and\\nrulers, often officiating as qazi, and enjoying the\\ncosmopolitan culture of urban centres where people\\nwho spoke Arabic, Persian, Turkish and other\\nlanguages, shared ideas, information and anecdotes.\\nThese included stories about men noted for their\\npiety, kings who could be both cruel and generous,\\nand about the lives of ordinary men and women;\\nanything that was unfamiliar was particularly\\nhighlighted in order to ensure that the listener or\\nthe reader was suitably impressed by accounts of\\ndistant yet accessible worlds.\\n5.1 The coconut and the paan\\nSome of the best examples of Ibn Battuta’s strategies\\nof representation are evident in the ways in which\\nhe described the coconut and the paan, two kinds of\\nplant produce that were completely unfamiliar to\\nhis audience.\\nThe paan\\nRead Ibn Battuta’s description of the paan:\\nThe betel is a tree which is cultivated in the same\\nmanner as the grape-vine; … The betel has no fruit\\nand is grown only for the sake of its leaves … The\\nmanner of its use is that before eating it one takes\\nareca nut; this is like a nutmeg but is broken up until it\\nis reduced to small pellets, and one places these in his\\nmouth and chews them. Then he takes the leaves of\\nbetel, puts a little chalk on them, and masticates them\\nalong with the betel.Nuts lik e a man ’s head\\nThe following is how Ibn Battuta\\ndescribed the coconut:\\nThese trees are among the\\nmost peculiar trees in kind\\nand most astonishing in\\nhabit. They look exactly\\nlike date-palms, without\\nany difference between\\nthem except that the one\\nproduces nuts as its fruits\\nand the other produces\\ndates. The nut of a coconut\\ntree r esembles a man ’s\\nhead, for in it are what look\\nlike two eyes and a mouth,\\nand the inside of it when it is\\ngreen looks like the brain,\\nand attached to it is a fibre\\nwhich looks lik e hair .

They were\\ndensely populated and prosperous, except for the\\noccasional disruptions caused by wars and\\ninvasions. It appears from Ibn Battuta’s account that\\nmost cities had crowded streets and bright and\\ncolourful markets that were stacked with a wide\\nvariety of goods. Ibn Battuta described Delhi as a\\nvast city, with a great population, the largest in India.\\nDaulatabad (in Maharashtra) was no less, and easily\\nrivalled Delhi in size.\\nSource 8\\nDehli\\nHere is an excerpt from Ibn Battuta’s account of Delhi, often spelt as Dehli in texts\\nof the period:\\nThe city of Dehli covers a wide area and has a large population ...\\nThe rampart round the city is without parallel. The breadth of its wall\\nis eleven cubits; and inside it are houses for the night sentry and gate-\\nkeepers. Inside the ramparts, there are store-houses for storing edibles ,\\nmagazines, ammunition, ballistas and siege machines. The grains that\\nare stored (in these ramparts) can last for a long time, without rotting\\n... In the interior of the rampart, horsemen as well as infantrymen\\nmove fr om one end of the city to another . The rampart is pier ced\\nthrough by windows which open on the side of the city , and it is\\nthrough these windows that light enters inside. The lower part of the\\nrampart is built of stone; the upper part of bricks. It has many towers\\nclose to one another . Ther e are twenty eight gates of this city which\\nare called darwaza , and of these, the Budaun darwaza  is the greatest;\\ninside the Mandwi darwaza  there is a grain market; adjacent to the\\nGul darwaza  there is an orchard ... It (the city of Dehli) has a fine cemetery in which graves have\\ndomes over them, and those that do not have a dome, have an arch, for sure. In the cemetery\\nthey sow flowers such\\nas tuberose, jasmine,\\nwild rose, etc.; and\\nflowers blossom there\\nin all seasons./circleright What were the architectural\\nfeatures that Ibn Battuta\\nnoted?\\nCompare this description with\\nthe illustrations of the city\\nshown in Figs. 5.8 and 5.9.THROUGH  THE EYES OF TRAVELLERS\\nFig. 5.8 (top)\\nAn arch in Tughlakabad,\\nDelhi\\nFig. 5.9 (left)\\nPart of the fortification\\nwall of the settlement\\n2024-25\\n THEMES  IN INDIAN H ISTORY  – P ART II 128\\nThe bazaars were not only places of economic\\ntransactions, but also the hub of social and cultural\\nactivities. Most bazaars had a mosque and a temple,\\nand in some of them at least, spaces were marked for\\npublic performances by dancers, musicians and singers .\\nWhile Ibn Battuta was not particularly concerned\\nwith explaining the prosperity of towns, historians have\\nused his account to suggest that towns derived a\\nsignificant portion of their wealth through the\\nappropriation of surplus from villages. Ibn Battuta\\nfound Indian  agriculture very productive because of\\nthe fertility of the soil, which allowed farmers to\\ncultivate two crops a year. He also noted that the\\nsubcontinent was well integrated with inter-Asian\\nnetworks of trade and commerce, with Indian\\nmanufactures being in great demand in both West Asia\\nand Southeast Asia, fetching huge profits for artisans\\nand merchants. Indian textiles, particularly cotton\\ncloth, fine muslins, silks, brocade and satin, were in\\ngreat demand. Ibn Battuta informs us that certain\\nvarieties of fine muslin were so expensive that they\\ncould be worn only by the nobles and the very rich.\\nMusic in the market\\nRead Ibn Battuta’s description of Daulatabad:\\nIn Daulatabad there is a market place for male and\\nfemale singers, which is known as T arababad. It is one\\nof the greatest and most beautiful bazaars. It has\\nnumerous shops and every shop has a door which\\nleads into the house of the owner ... The shops are\\ndecorated with carpets and at the centre of a shop\\nthere is a swing on which sits the female singer . She is\\ndecked with all kinds of finery and her female attendants\\nswing her . In the middle of the mark et place ther e stands\\na large cupola, which is carpeted and decorated and\\nin which the chief of the musicians takes his place every\\nThursday after the dawn prayers, accompanied by his\\nservants and slaves.

One of the Hindu rulers\\n... alighted at the cupola every time he passed by this\\nmarket place, and the female singers would sing before\\nhim. Even some Muslim rulers did the same.Source 9\\nFig. 5.10\\nIkat weaving patterns such as this\\nwere adopted and modified at\\nseveral coastal production centres\\nin the subcontinent and in\\nSoutheast Asia.\\n/circleright Why do you think Ibn\\nBattuta highlighted these\\nactivities in his description?\\n2024-25\\n129\\n5.3 A unique system of communication\\nThe state evidently took special measures to\\nencourage merchants. Almost all trade routes were\\nwell supplied with inns and guest houses. Ibn\\nBattuta was also amazed by the efficiency of the\\npostal system which allowed merchants to not only\\nsend information and remit credit across long\\ndistances, but also to dispatch goods required at\\nshort notice. The postal system was so efficient that\\nwhile it took fifty days to reach Delhi from Sind,\\nthe news reports of spies would reach the Sultan\\nthrough the postal system in just five days.\\nOn horse and on foot\\nThis is how Ibn Battuta describes the postal system:\\nIn India the postal system is of two kinds. The horse-\\npost, called uluq,  is run by royal horses stationed at a\\ndistance of every four miles. The foot-post has three\\nstations per mile; it is called dawa,  that is one-third of a\\nmile ...  Now , at every thir d of a mile ther e is a well-\\npopulated village, outside which are three pavilions in\\nwhich sit men with girded loins ready to start. Each of\\nthem carries a rod, two cubits in length, with copper\\nbells at the top. When the courier starts from the city\\nhe holds the letter in one hand and the rod with its\\nbells on the other; and he runs as fast as he can. When\\nthe men in the pavilion hear the ringing of the bell they\\nget ready . As soon as the courier r eaches them, one of\\nthem takes the letter from his hand and runs at top\\nspeed shaking the rod all the while until he reaches\\nthe next dawa.  And the same process continues till the\\nletter reaches its destination. This foot-post is quicker\\nthan the horse-post; and often it is used to transport\\nthe fruits of Khurasan which are much desired in India.\\n/circleright Discuss...\\nHow did Ibn Battuta handle the problem of\\ndescribing things or situations to people who\\nhad not seen or experienced them?A strange nation?\\nThe travelogue of Abdur Razzaq\\nwritten in the 1440s is an\\ninteresting mixture of emotions\\nand perceptions. On the one\\nhand, he did not appreciate\\nwhat he saw in the port of\\nCalicut (present-day Kozhikode)\\nin Kerala, which was populated\\nby “a people the likes of whom I\\nhad never imagined”, describing\\nthem as “a strange nation ”.\\nLater in his visit to India, he\\narrived in Mangalore, and\\ncrossed the W estern Ghats.

Bernier and the “Degenerate”\\nEast\\nIf Ibn Battuta chose to describe everything that\\nimpressed and excited him because of its novelty,\\nFrançois Bernier belonged to a different intellectual\\ntradition. He was far more preoccupied with\\ncomparing and contrasting what he saw in India\\nwith the situation in Europe in general and France\\nin particular, focusing on situations which he\\nconsidered depressing. His idea seems to have been\\nto influence policy-makers and the intelligentsia to\\nensure that they made what he considered to be the\\n“right” decisions.\\nBernier’s Travels in the Mughal Empire  is marked\\nby detailed observations, critical insights and\\nreflection. His account contains discussions trying\\nto place the history of the Mughals within some sort\\nof a universal framework. He constantly compared\\nMughal India with contemporary Europe, generally\\nemphasising the superiority of the latter. His\\nrepresentation of India works on the model of\\nbinary opposition, where India is presented as the\\ninverse of Europe. He also ordered the perceived\\ndifferences hierarchically, so that India appeared to\\nbe inferior to the Western world.\\n6.1 The question of landownership\\nAccording to Bernier, one of the fundamental\\ndifferences between Mughal India and Europe was\\nthe lack of private property in land in the former.\\nHe was a firm believer in the virtues of private\\nproperty, and saw crown ownership of land as\\nbeing harmful for both the state and its people. He\\nthought that in the Mughal Empire the emperor\\nowned all the land and distributed it among his\\nnobles, and that this had disastrous consequences\\nfor the economy and society. This perception was\\nnot unique to Bernier, but is found in most\\ntravellers’ accounts of the sixteenth and\\nseventeenth centuries.\\nOwing to crown ownership of land, argued Bernier,\\nlandholders could not pass on their land to their\\nchildren. So they were averse to any long-term\\ninvestment in the sustenance and expansion of\\nproduction. The absence of private property in land\\nhad, therefore, prevented the emergence of the class\\nof “improving” landlords (as in Western Europe) withWidespread poverty\\nPelsaert, a Dutch traveller , visited\\nthe subcontinent during the early\\ndecades of the seventeenth\\ncentury . Lik e Bernier , he was\\nshocked to see the widespread\\npoverty ,  “poverty so gr eat and\\nmiserable that the life of the\\npeople can be depicted or\\naccurately described only as the\\nhome of stark want and the\\ndwelling place of bitter woe”.\\nHolding the state responsible,\\nhe says: “So much is wrung\\nfrom the peasants that even dry\\nbread is scarcely left to fill\\ntheir stomachs.”\\n2024-25\\n131\\na concern to maintain or improve the land. It had\\nled to the uniform ruination of agriculture, excessive\\noppression of the peasantry and a continuous decline\\nin the living standards of all sections of society, except\\nthe ruling aristocracy.\\nThe poor peasant\\nAn excerpt from Bernier’s description of the peasantry in\\nthe countryside:\\nOf the vast tracts of country constituting the empire of\\nHindustan, many are little more than sand, or barren\\nmountains, badly cultivated, and thinly populated.\\nEven a considerable portion of the good land remains\\nuntilled for want of labourers; many of whom perish in\\nconsequence of the bad treatment they experience\\nfrom Governors. The poor people, when they become\\nincapable of discharging the demands of their\\nrapacious lords, are not only often deprived of the\\nmeans of subsistence, but are also made to lose their\\nchildren, who are carried away as slaves. Thus, it\\nhappens that the peasantry , driven to despair by so\\nexcessive a tyranny , abandon the country .\\nIn this instance, Bernier was participating in\\ncontemporary debates in Europe concerning the nature\\nof state and society , and intended that his description of\\nMughal India would serve as a warning to those who did\\nnot r ecognise the “merits” of private pr operty .\\nAs an extension of this, Bernier described Indian\\nsociety as consisting of undifferentiated masses of\\nimpoverished people, subjugated by a small minority\\nof a very rich and powerful ruling class. Between\\nthe poorest of the poor and the richest of the rich,\\nthere was no social group or class worth the name.\\nBernier confidently asserted: “There is no middle\\nstate in India.”Source 11\\n/circleright What, accor ding to Ber nier, were the\\nproblems faced by peasants in the\\nsubcontinent? Do you think his description\\nwould have served to strengthen his case?THROUGH  THE EYES OF TRAVELLERS\\nFig. 5.11\\nDrawings such as this\\nnineteenth-century example\\noften reinforced the notion of\\nan unchanging rural society.\\n2024-25\\n THEMES  IN INDIAN H ISTORY  – P ART II 132\\nThis, then, is how Bernier saw the Mughal Empire\\n– its king was the king of “beggars and barbarians”;\\nits cities and towns were ruined and contaminated\\nwith “ill air”; and its fields, “overspread with bushes”\\nand full of “pestilential marishes”. And, all this was\\nbecause of one reason: crown ownership of land.\\nCuriously, none of the Mughal official documents\\nsuggest that the state was the sole owner of land.\\nFor instance, Abu’l Fazl, the sixteenth-century\\nofficial chronicler of Akbar’s reign, describes the land\\nrevenue as “remunerations of sovereignty”, a claim\\nmade by the ruler on his subjects for the protection\\nhe provided rather than as rent on land that he\\nowned. It is possible that European travellers\\nregarded such claims as rent because land revenue\\ndemands were often very high. However, this was\\nactually not a rent or even a land tax, but a tax on\\nthe crop (for more details, see Chapter 8).\\nBernier’s descriptions influenced Western\\ntheorists from the eighteenth century onwards.  The\\nFrench philosopher Montesquieu, for instance, used\\nthis account to develop the idea of oriental despotism,\\naccording to which rulers in Asia (the Orient or the\\nEast) enjoyed absolute authority over their subjects,\\nwho were kept in conditions of subjugation and\\npoverty, arguing that all land belonged to the king\\nand that private property was non-existent.\\nAccording to this view, everybody, except the emperor\\nand his nobles, barely managed to survive.\\nThis idea was further developed as the concept of\\nthe Asiatic mode of production by Karl Marx in the\\nnineteenth century. He argued that in India (and\\nother Asian countries), before colonialism, surplus\\nwas appropriated by the state. This led to the\\nemergence of a society that was composed of a large\\nnumber of autonomous and (internally) egalitarian\\nvillage communities. The imperial court presided\\nover these village communities, respecting their\\nautonomy as long as the flow of surplus was\\nunimpeded. This was regarded as a stagnant system.\\nHowever, as we will see (Chapter 8), this picture\\nof rural society was far from true. In fact, during\\nthe sixteenth and seventeenth centuries, rural\\nsociety was characterised by considerable social and\\neconomic differentiation. At one end of the spectrum\\nwere the big zamindars , who enjoyed superior rights\\nin land and, at the other, the “untouchable” landlessA warning for Europe\\nBernier warned that if\\nEuropean kings followed the\\nMughal model:\\nTheir kingdoms would be\\nvery far from being well-\\ncultivated and peopled,\\nso well built, so rich, so\\npolite and flourishing as\\nwe see them. Our kings\\nare otherwise rich and\\npowerful; and we must\\navow that they are much\\nbetter and more royally\\nserved.

In between was the big peasant, who used\\nhired labour and engaged in commodity production, and\\nthe smaller peasant who could barely produce for his\\nsubsistence.\\n6.2 A more complex social reality\\nWhile Bernier’s preoccupation with projecting the\\nMughal state as tyrannical is obvious, his descriptions\\noccasionally hint at a more complex social reality. For\\ninstance, he felt that artisans had no incentive to\\nimprove the quality of their manufactures, since profits\\nwere appropriated by the state. Manufactures were,\\nconsequently, everywhere in decline.  At the same time,\\nhe conceded that vast quantities of the world’s precious\\nmetals flowed into India, as manufactures were exported\\nin exchange for gold and silver. He also noticed the\\nexistence of a prosperous merchant community,\\nengaged in long-distance exchange.\\nSource 13\\nA different socio-economic scenario\\nRead this excerpt from Bernier’s description of both\\nagriculture and craft production:\\nIt is important to observe, that of this vast tract of country ,\\na large portion is extremely fertile; the large kingdom of\\nBengale (Bengal), for instance, surpassing Egypt itself, not\\nonly in the production of rice, corn, and other necessaries\\nof life, but of innumerable articles of commerce which are\\nnot cultivated in Egypt; such as silks, cotton, and indigo.\\nThere are also many parts of the Indies, where the\\npopulation is sufficiently abundant, and the land pretty well\\ntilled; and where the artisan, although naturally indolent,\\nis yet compelled by necessity or otherwise to employ himself\\nin manufacturing carpets, brocades, embroideries, gold\\nand silver cloths, and the various sorts of silk and cotton\\ngoods, which are used in the country or exported abroad.\\nIt should not escape notice that gold and silver , after\\ncirculating in every other quarter of the globe, come at\\nlength to be swallowed up, lost in some measure, in\\nHindustan.\\n/circleright In what ways is the description in this excerpt\\ndifferent from that in Source 11?THROUGH  THE EYES OF TRAVELLERS\\nFig. 5.12\\nA gold spoon studded with\\nemeralds and rubies, an\\nexample of the dexterity of\\nMughal artisans\\n2024-25\\n THEMES  IN INDIAN H ISTORY  – P ART II 134\\nIn fact, during the seventeenth century about\\n15 per cent of the population lived in towns. This\\nwas, on average, higher than the proportion of urban\\npopulation in Western Europe in the same period.\\nIn spite of this Bernier described Mughal cities as\\n“camp towns”, by which he meant towns that owed\\ntheir existence, and depended for their survival,\\non the imperial camp. He believed that these came\\ninto existence when the imperial court moved in\\nand rapidly declined when it moved out. He\\nsuggested that they did not have viable social and\\neconomic foundations but were dependent on\\nimperial patronage.\\nAs in the case of the question of landownership,\\nBernier was drawing an oversimplified picture.\\nThere were all kinds of towns: manufacturing\\ntowns, trading towns, port-towns, sacred centres,\\npilgrimage towns, etc. Their existence is an index\\nof the prosperity of merchant communities and\\nprofessional classes.\\nMerchants often had strong community or kin ties,\\nand were organised into their own caste-cum-\\noccupational bodies. In western India these groups\\nwere called mahajans,  and their chief, the sheth.  In\\nurban centres such as Ahmedabad the mahajans\\nwere collectively represented by the chief of the\\nmerchant community who was called the nagarsheth.\\nOther urban groups included professional\\nclasses such as physicians ( hakim  or vaid), teachers\\n(pundit or mulla ), lawyers (wakil), painters,\\narchitects, musicians, calligraphers, etc. While\\nsome depended on imperial patronage, many made\\ntheir living by serving other patrons, while still\\nothers served ordinary people in crowded markets\\nor bazaars.The imperial karkhanas\\nBernier is perhaps the only\\nhistorian who provides a detailed\\naccount of the working of\\nthe imperial karkhanas  or\\nworkshops:\\nLarge halls are seen\\nat many places, called\\nkarkhanas  or workshops\\nfor the artisans.

Women\\nSla ves, Sati  and Labour ers\\nTravellers who left written accounts were\\ngenerally men who were interested in and\\nsometimes intrigued by the condition of\\nwomen in the subcontinent. Sometimes they\\ntook social inequities for granted as a\\n“natural” state of affairs. For instance,\\nslaves were openly sold in markets, like any\\nother commodity, and were regularly\\nexchanged as gifts. When Ibn Battuta\\nreached Sind he purchased “horses, camels\\nand slaves” as gifts for Sultan Muhammad\\nbin Tughlaq. When he reached Multan, he\\npresented the governor with, “a slave and\\nhorse together with raisins and almonds”.\\nMuhammad bin Tughlaq, informs Ibn\\nBattuta, was so happy with the sermon of a\\npreacher named Nasiruddin that he gave him\\n“a hundred thousand tankas  (coins) and\\ntwo hundred slaves”.\\nIt appears from Ibn Battuta’s account that\\nthere was considerable differentiation among\\nslaves. Some female slaves in the service of\\nthe Sultan were experts in music and dance,\\nand Ibn Battuta enjoyed their performance\\nat the wedding of the Sultan’s sister. Female\\nslaves were also employed by the Sultan to\\nkeep a watch on his nobles.\\nSlaves were generally used for domestic\\nlabour, and Ibn Battuta found their services\\nparticularly indispensable for carrying\\nwomen and men on palanquins or dola. The\\nprice of slaves, particularly female slaves\\nrequired for domestic labour, was very  low,\\nand most families who could afford to do so\\nkept  at least one or two of them.\\nContemporary European travellers and\\nwriters often highlighted the treatment of\\nwomen as a crucial marker of difference\\nbetween Western and Eastern societies. Not\\nsurprisingly, Bernier chose the practice of\\nsati for detailed description. He noted that\\nwhile some women seemed to embrace death\\ncheerfully, others were forced to die.Source 15THROUGH  THE EYES OF TRAVELLERS\\nSource 16\\nThe child sati\\nThis is perhaps one of the most\\npoignant descriptions by Bernier:\\nAt Lahore I saw a most beautiful\\nyoung widow sacrificed, who\\ncould not, I think, have been more\\nthan twelve years of age.

       "  'text': ' THEMES IN INDIAN HISTORY – PART  II 140\\nWe saw in Chapter 4 that by the mid-first\\nmillennium CE the landscape of the subcontinent\\nwas dotted with a variety of religious structures –\\nstupas , monasteries, temples. If these typified\\ncertain religious beliefs and practices, others have\\nbeen reconstructed from textual traditions,\\nincluding the Puranas , many of which received\\ntheir present shape around the same time, and yet\\nothers remain only faintly visible in textual and\\nvisual records.\\nNew textual sources available from this period\\ninclude compositions attributed to poet-saints,\\nmost of whom expressed themselves orally in\\nregional languages used by ordinary people. These\\ncompositions, which were often set to music, were\\ncompiled by disciples or devotees, generally after\\nthe death of the poet-saint. What is more, these\\ntraditions were fluid – generations of devotees tended\\nto elaborate on the original message, and occasionally\\nmodified or even abandoned some of the ideas that\\nappeared problematic or irrelevant in different\\npolitical, social or cultural contexts. Using these\\nsources thus poses a challenge to historians .\\nHistorians also draw on hagiographies or\\nbiographies of saints written by their followers (or\\nmembers of their religious sect). These may not be\\nliterally accurate, but allow a glimpse into the ways\\nin which devotees perceived the lives of these path-\\nbreaking women and men.\\nAs we will see, these sources provide us with\\ninsights into a scenario characterised by dynamism\\nand diversity. Let us look at some elements of these\\nmore closely.Bhakt i-Suf i Traditions\\nChanges in Religious Beliefs andChanges in Religious Beliefs andChanges in Religious Beliefs andChanges in Religious Beliefs andChanges in Religious Beliefs and\\nDe DeDe DeDev vv vvo oo ootional T\\ntional Ttional T tional Ttional T e ee eexts xtsxts xtsxts\\n( (( ((c cc cc. eighth to eighteenth century). eighth to eighteenth century). eighth to eighteenth century). eighth to eighteenth century). eighth to eighteenth century)\\nFig. 6.1\\nA twelfth-century bronze sculpture of\\nManikkavachakar , a devotee of Shiva\\nwho composed beautiful devotional songs in Tamil\\nTHEME\\nSIX\\n2024-25\\n141\\n“Great” and “little”\\ntraditions\\nThe terms great and little\\ntraditions were coined by a\\nsociologist named Robert\\nRedfield in the twentieth\\ncentury to describe the cultural\\npractices of peasant societies.\\nHe found that peasants\\nobserved rituals and customs\\nthat emanated from dominant\\nsocial categories, including\\npriests and rulers. These he\\nclassified as part of  a great\\ntradition. At the same time,\\npeasants also followed local\\npractices that did not\\nnecessarily correspond with\\nthose of the great tradition.\\nThese he included within the\\ncategory of little tradition. He\\nalso noticed that both great\\nand little traditions changed\\nover time, through a process of\\ninteraction.\\nWhile scholars accept the\\nsignificance of these categories\\nand processes, they are\\noften uncomfortable with the\\nhierarchy suggested by the\\nterms great and little. The use\\nof quotation marks for “great”\\nand “little” is one way of\\nindicating this.1. A Mosaic of R eligious Belief s\\nand Practices\\nPerhaps the most striking feature of this phase is\\nthe increasing visibility of a wide range of gods and\\ngoddesses in sculpture as well as in texts. At one\\nlevel, this indicates the continued and even extended\\nworship of the major deities – Vishnu, Shiva and\\nthe goddess – each of whom was visualised in a\\nvariety of forms.\\n1.1 The integration of cults\\nHistorians who have tried to understand these\\ndevelopments suggest that there were at least  two\\nprocesses at work. One was a process of  disseminating\\nBrahmanical ideas. This is exemplified by the\\ncomposition, compilation and preservation of Puranic\\ntexts in simple Sanskrit verse, explicitly meant to\\nbe accessible to women and Shudras, who were\\ngenerally excluded fr om V edic lear ning. At the same\\ntime, there was a second process at work – that of\\nthe Brahmanas accepting and reworking the beliefs\\nand practices of these and other social categories. In\\nfact, many beliefs and practices were shaped through\\na continuous dialogue between what sociologists have\\ndescribed as “great” Sanskritic Puranic traditions\\nand “little” traditions throughout the land.\\nOne of the most striking examples of this process\\nis evident at Puri, Orissa, where the principal deity\\nwas identified, by the twelfth century, as Jagannatha\\n(literally, the lord of the world), a form of Vishnu.\\nFig. 6.2\\nJagannatha (extreme right) with his\\nsister Subhadra (centre) and his\\nbrother Balarama (left)BHAKT I-SUFI TRADITIONS\\n2024-25\\n THEMES  IN INDIAN H ISTORY  – P ART II 142\\nIf you compare Fig. 6.2 with Fig. 4.26 (Chapter 4)\\nyou will notice that the deity is represented in a\\nvery different way. In this instance, a local deity,\\nwhose image was and continues to be made of wood\\nby local tribal specialists, was recognised as a form\\nof Vishnu. At the same time, Vishnu was visualised\\nin a way that was very different from that in other\\nparts of the country.\\nSuch instances of integration are evident\\namongst goddess cults as well. W orship of the\\ngoddess, often simply in the form of a stone smeared\\nwith ochre, was evidently widespread. These local\\ndeities were often incorporated within the Puranic\\nframework by providing them with an identity as a\\nwife of the principal male deities – sometimes they\\nwere equated with Lakshmi, the wife of Vishnu, in\\nother instances, with Parvati, the wife of Shiva.\\n1.2 Difference and conflict\\nOften associated with the goddess were forms\\nof worship that were classified as Tantric. Tantric\\npractices were widespread in several parts of the\\nsubcontinent – they were open to women and\\nmen, and practitioners often ignored differences\\nof caste and class within the ritual context. Many\\nof these ideas influenced Shaivism as well as\\nBuddhism,  especially in the eastern, northern and\\nsouthern parts of the subcontinent.\\nAll of these somewhat divergent and even disparate\\nbeliefs and practices would  come to be classified as\\nHindu over the course of the next millennium. The\\ndivergence is per haps most stark if we compar e Vedic\\nand Puranic traditions. The principal deities of the\\nVedic pantheon, Agni, Indra and Soma, become\\nmarginal figures, rarely visible in textual or visual\\nrepresentations. And while we can catch a glimpse\\nof Vishnu, Shiva and the goddess in V edic mantras,\\nthese have little in common with the elaborate\\nPuranic mythologies. However , in spite of these\\nobvious discr epancies, the V edas continued to be\\nrevered as authoritative.\\nNot surprisingly, there were sometimes conflicts as\\nwell – those who valued the V edic tradition often\\ncondemned practices that went beyond the closely\\nregulated contact with the divine through the\\nperformance of sacrifices or precisely chanted mantras.\\nOn the other hand those engaged in Tantric practicesFig. 6.3\\nSculpture of a Buddhist goddess,\\nMarichi (c.tenth century, Bihar),\\nan example of the process of\\nintegration of different religious\\nbeliefs and practices\\n2024-25\\n143\\nfrequently ignor ed the authority of the V edas. Also,\\ndevotees often tended to project their chosen deity,\\neither Vishnu or Shiva, as supreme. Relations with\\nother traditions, such as Buddhism or Jainism, were\\nalso often fraught with tension if not open conflict.\\nThe traditions of devotion or bhakti need to be\\nlocated within this context.  Devotional worship had\\na long history of almost a thousand years before\\nthe period we are considering. During this time,\\nexpressions of devotion ranged from the routine\\nworship of deities within temples to ecstatic\\nadoration where devotees attained a trance-like\\nstate. The singing and chanting of devotional\\ncompositions was often a part of such modes of\\nworship. This was particularly true of the V aishnava\\nand Shaiva sects.\\n2. P oems of Pr ayer\\nEar ly Traditions of Bhakti\\nIn the course of the evolution of these forms of\\nworship,  in many instances, poet-saints emerged\\nas leaders around whom there developed a\\ncommunity of devotees. Further , while Brahmanas\\nremained important intermediaries between gods and\\ndevotees in several forms of bhakti, these traditions\\nalso accommodated and acknowledged women and\\nthe “lower castes”, categories considered ineligible\\nfor liberation within the orthodox Brahmanical\\nframework. What also characterised traditions of\\nbhakti was a remarkable diversity.\\nAt a different level, historians of religion often\\nclassify bhakti traditions into two broad categories:\\nsaguna (with attributes) and nirguna (without\\nattributes) . The former included traditions that\\nfocused on the worship of specific deities such\\nas Shiva, Vishnu and his avatars  (incarnations) and\\nforms of the goddess or Devi, all often conceptualised\\nin anthropomorphic forms. Nirguna bhakti on the\\nother hand was worship of an abstract form of god.\\n2.1 The Alvars and Nayanars of Tamil Nadu\\nSome of the earliest bhakti movements ( c. sixth\\ncentury) were led by the Alvars (literally, those who\\nare “immersed” in devotion to Vishnu) and Nayanars\\n(literally, leaders who were devotees of Shiva). They\\ntravelled from place to place singing hymns in Tamil\\nin praise of their gods./circleright Discuss...\\nFind out about gods and\\ngoddesses worshipped in your\\ntown or village, noting their\\nnames and the ways in which\\nthey are depicted.

To some\\nextent this is corroborated by the fact that bhaktas\\nhailed from diverse social backgrounds ranging from\\nBrahmanas to artisans and cultivators and even\\nfrom castes considered “untouchable”.\\nThe importance of the traditions of the Alvars\\nand Nayanars was sometimes indicated by the\\nclaim that their compositions were as important\\nas the V edas. For instance, one of the major\\nanthologies of compositions by the Alvars, the Nalayira\\nDivyaprabandham,  was frequently described as the\\nTamil V eda, thus claiming that the text was as\\nsignificant as the four V edas in Sanskrit that wer e\\ncherished by the Brahmanas.\\n2.3 W omen devotees\\nPerhaps one of the most striking features of these\\ntraditions was the presence of women. For instance,\\nthe compositions of Andal, a woman Alvar , were\\nwidely sung (and continue to be sung to date).

From the second half of the first\\nmillennium there is evidence for states, including\\nthose of the Pallavas and Pandyas ( c. sixth to ninth\\ncenturies CE). While Buddhism and Jainism had\\nbeen prevalent in this region for several centuries,\\ndrawing support from merchant and artisan\\ncommunities, these religious traditions received\\noccasional royal patronage.\\nInterestingly, one of the major themes in Tamil\\nbhakti hymns is the poets’ opposition to Buddhism\\nand Jainism. This is particularly marked in the\\n2024-25\\n THEMES  IN INDIAN H ISTORY  – P ART II 146\\ncompositions of the Nayanars. Historians have\\nattempted to explain this hostility by suggesting that\\nit was due to competition between members of\\nother religious traditions for royal patronage. What\\nis evident is that the powerful Chola rulers (ninth\\nto thirteenth centuries) supported Brahmanical\\nand bhakti traditions, making land grants and\\nconstructing temples for Vishnu and Shiva.\\nIn fact, some of the most magnificent Shiva\\ntemples, including those at Chidambaram, Thanjavur\\nand Gangaikondacholapuram, were constructed\\nunder the patronage of Chola rulers. This was also\\nthe period when some of the most spectacular\\nrepresentations of Shiva in bronze sculpture were\\nproduced. Clearly, the visions of the Nayanars\\ninspired artists.\\nBoth Nayanars and Alvars were revered by the\\nVellala peasants. Not surprisingly, rulers tried to\\nwin their support as well. The Chola kings, for\\ninstance, often attempted to claim divine support\\nand proclaim their own power and status by building\\nsplendid temples that were adorned\\nwith stone and metal sculpture to\\nrecreate the visions of these popular\\nsaints who sang in the language of\\nthe people.\\nThese kings also introduced the\\nsinging of Tamil Shaiva hymns in\\nthe temples under royal patronage,\\ntaking the initiative to collect and\\norganise them into a text ( Tevaram ).\\nFurther , inscriptional evidence fr om\\naround 945 suggests that the Chola\\nruler Parantaka I had consecrated\\nmetal images of Appar , Sambandar\\nand Sundarar in a Shiva temple.\\nThese were carried in processions\\nduring the festivals of these saints.Fig. 6.5\\nAn image of Shiva as Nataraja\\n/circleright Discuss...\\nWhy do you think kings were\\ninterested in proclaiming their\\nconnections with bhaktas?\\n2024-25\\n147\\nRituals and the\\nreal world\\nHere is a vachana  composed\\nby Basavanna:\\nWhen they see a serpent\\ncarved in stone they pour\\nmilk on it.\\nIf a real serpent comes they\\nsay: “Kill.

The V irashaiv a Tradition\\nin K arnat aka\\nThe twelfth century witnessed the emergence of a\\nnew movement in Karnataka, led by a Brahmana\\nnamed Basavanna (1106-68) who was a minister in\\nthe court of a Kalachuri ruler. His followers were\\nknown as Virashaivas (heroes of Shiva) or Lingayats\\n(wearers of the linga).\\nLingayats continue to be an important community\\nin the region to date. They worship Shiva in his\\nmanifestation as a linga , and men usually wear a\\nsmall linga in a silver case on a loop strung over the\\nleft shoulder . Those who ar e revered include the\\njangama or wandering monks. Lingayats believe\\nthat on death the devotee will be united with Shiva\\nand will not return to this world. Therefore they do\\nnot practise funerary rites such as cremation,\\nprescribed in the Dharmashastras. Instead, they\\nceremonially bury their dead.\\nThe Lingayats challenged the idea of caste and\\nthe “pollution” attributed to certain groups by\\nBrahmanas. They also questioned the theory of\\nrebirth. These won them followers amongst those\\nwho were marginalised within the Brahmanical\\nsocial or der. The Lingayats also encouraged certain\\npractices disapproved in the Dharmashastras,\\nsuch as post-puberty marriage and the remarriage\\nof widows. Our understanding of the Virashaiva\\ntradition is derived from vachanas  (literally, sayings)\\ncomposed in Kannada by women and men who\\njoined the movement.\\nNew religious developments\\nThis period also  witnessed two major developments.\\nOn the one hand , many ideas of the T amil bhaktas\\n(especially the V aishnavas) wer e incorporated within\\nthe Sanskritic tradition, culminating in the composition\\nof one of the best-known Puranas, the Bhagavata\\nPurana . Second, we find the development of traditions\\nof bhakti in Maharashtra in the thirteenth century .\\n2024-25\\n THEMES  IN INDIAN H ISTORY  – P ART II 148\\n4. Religious Ferment in\\nNorth India\\nDuring the same period, in north India deities such as\\nVishnu and Shiva were worshipped in temples, often built\\nwith the support of rulers. However , historians have not\\nfound evidence of anything resembling the compositions\\nof the Alvars and Nayanars till the fourteenth century.\\nHow do we account for this difference?\\nSome historians point out that in north India this\\nwas the period when several Rajput states emerged. In\\nmost of these states Brahmanas occupied positions of\\nimportance, performing a range of secular and ritual\\nfunctions. There seems to have been little or no attempt\\nto challenge their position directly.\\nAt the same time other\\nreligious leaders, who did not\\nfunction  within the orthodox\\nBrahmanical framework, were\\ngaining ground. These included\\nthe Naths, Jogis and Siddhas.\\nMany of them came  from\\nartisanal groups, including\\nweavers, who were becoming\\nincreasingly important with the\\ndevelopment of organised craft\\nproduction. Demand for such\\nproduction grew with the\\nemergence of new urban centres,\\nand long-distance trade with\\nCentral Asia and W est Asia.\\nMany of these new religious\\nleaders questioned the\\nauthority of the V edas, and\\nexpressed themselves in languages spoken by ordinary\\npeople, which developed over centuries into the ones\\nused today. However , in spite of their popularity these\\nreligious leaders were not in a position to win the\\nsupport of the ruling elites.\\nA new element in this situation was the coming of\\nthe Turks which culminated in the establishment of the\\nDelhi Sultanate (thirteenth century). This undermined\\nthe power of many of the Rajput states and the\\nBrahmanas who were associated with these kingdoms.\\nThis was accompanied by marked changes in the realm\\nof culture and religion. The coming of the sufis\\n(Section 6) was a significant part of these developments.\\nFig. 6.6\\nFragment of a page from the\\nQur’an, belonging to a\\nmanuscript dating to the\\neighth or ninth century\\n2024-25\\n149\\nUlama  (plural of alim, or one\\nwho knows) are scholars of\\nIslamic studies. As preservers of\\nthis tradition they perform\\nvarious religious, juridical and\\nteaching functions.5. N ew S trands in t he F abr ic\\nIslamic Traditions\\nJust as the regions within the subcontinent were\\nnot isolated fr om one another , so too, contact with\\nlands beyond the seas and mountains had existed\\nfor millennia. Arab merchants, for instance,\\nfrequented ports along the western coast in the first\\nmillennium CE, while Central Asian people settled\\nin the north-western parts of the subcontinent\\nduring the same period. From the seventh century,\\nwith the advent of Islam, these regions became part\\nof what is often termed the Islamic world.\\n5.1 Faiths of rulers and subjects\\nOne axis of understanding the significance of these\\nconnections that is frequently adopted is to focus on\\nthe religions of ruling elites. In 711 an Arab general\\nnamed Muhammad Qasim conquered Sind, which\\nbecame part of the Caliph’s domain. Later ( c. thirteenth\\ncentury) the Turks and Afghans established the\\nDelhi Sultanate.  This was followed by the formation\\nof Sultanates in the Deccan and other parts of the\\nsubcontinent; Islam was an acknowledged religion of\\nrulers in several areas. This continued with the\\nestablishment of the Mughal Empire in the sixteenth\\ncentury as well as in many of the regional states that\\nemerged in the eighteenth century.\\nTheor etically, Muslim rulers were to be guided by\\nthe ulama, who were expected to ensure that they\\nruled according to the  shari‘a.  Clearly, the situation\\nwas complicated in the subcontinent, where there\\nwere populations that did not subscribe to Islam.\\nIt is in this context that the category of the zimmi,\\nmeaning protected  (derived from the Arabic word\\nzimma , protection) developed for people who followed\\nrevealed scriptures, such as the Jews and Christians,\\nand lived under Muslim rulership. They paid a tax\\ncalled jizya and gained the right to be protected by\\nMuslims.  In India this status was extended to Hindus\\nas well. As you will see (Chapter 9), rulers such as\\nthe Mughals came to regard themselves as emperors\\nof not just Muslims but of all peoples.\\nIn effect, rulers often adopted a fairly flexible policy\\ntowards their subjects. For instance, several rulers\\ngave land endowments and granted tax exemptions\\nto Hindu, Jaina, Zoroastrian, Christian and Jewish\\nreligious institutions and also expressed respect andShari‘a\\nThe shari‘a  is the law governing\\nthe Muslim community . It is\\nbased on the Qur’an and the\\nhadis , traditions of the Prophet\\nincluding a record of his\\nremembered words and deeds.\\nWith the expansion of Islamic\\nrule outside Arabia, in areas\\nwhere customs and traditions\\nwere different, qiyas  (reasoning\\nby analogy) and ijma\\n(consensus of the community)\\nwere recognised as two other\\nsources of legislation.

All those who\\nadopted Islam accepted, in principle, the five “pillars”\\nof the faith: that there is one God, Allah, and Prophet\\nMuhammad is his messenger ( shahada ); offering\\nprayers five times a day ( namaz/sala t); giving alms\\n(zaka t); fasting during the month of Ramzan ( sawm);\\nand performing the pilgrimage to Mecca ( hajj).\\nHowever , these universal featur es wer e often\\noverlaid with diversities in practice derived from\\nsectarian affiliations (Sunni, Shi‘a), and the influence\\nof local customary practices of converts from different\\nsocial milieus. For example, the Khojahs, a branch\\nof the Ismailis (a Shi‘a sect), developed new modes\\nof communication, disseminating ideas derived from\\nthe Qur’an through indigenous literary genres. These\\nincluded the ginan  (derived from the Sanskrit jnana ,\\nmeaning “knowledge”), devotional poems in Punjabi,\\nMultani, Sindhi, Kachchi, Hindi and Gujarati, sung\\nin special ragas  during daily prayer meetings.\\nElsewhere, Arab Muslim traders who settled\\nalong the Malabar coast (Kerala) adopted the\\nlocal language, Malayalam. They also adopted\\nlocal customs such as matriliny (Chapter 3) and\\nmatrilocal residence.\\nThe complex blend of a universal faith with local\\ntraditions is perhaps best exemplified in the\\narchitecture of mosques. Some architectural features\\nFig. 6.8\\nA Khojaki manuscript\\nThe ginan were transmitted\\norally before being recorded in the\\nKhojaki script that was derived\\nfrom the local landa  (“clipped”\\nmercantile script) used by the\\nlinguistically diverse community\\nof Khojahs in the Punjab, Sind\\nand Gujarat.\\nMatrilocal  residence is a\\npractice where women after\\nmarriage remain in their natal\\nhome with their children and\\nthe husbands may come to stay\\nwith them.\\nFig. 6.9\\nA mosque in Kerala,\\nc. thirteenth century\\nNote the shikhara -like roof.BHAKT I-SUFI TRADITIONS\\n2024-25\\n THEMES  IN INDIAN H ISTORY  – P ART II 152\\nof mosques are universal – such as\\ntheir orientation towards Mecca,\\nevident in the placement of the mihrab\\n(prayer niche) and the minbar (pulpit).\\nHowever , ther e are several featur es\\nthat show variations – such as roofs\\nand building materials (see Figs. 6.9,\\n6.10 and 6.11).\\n5.3 Names for communities\\nWe often take the ter ms Hindu and\\nMuslim for granted, as labels for\\nreligious communities. Y et, these\\nterms did not gain currency for a very\\nlong time. Historians who have studied\\nSanskrit texts and inscriptions dating\\nbetween the eighth and fourteenth\\ncenturies point out that the term\\nmusalman or Muslim was virtually\\nnever used.

The Gr owth of Suf ism\\nIn the early centuries of Islam a group of religious-\\nminded people called sufis turned to asceticism and\\nmysticism in protest against the growing materialism\\nof the Caliphate as a religious and political institution.\\nThey were critical of the dogmatic definitions and\\nscholastic methods of interpreting the Qur’an and sunna\\n(traditions of the Prophet) adopted by theologians.\\nInstead, they laid emphasis on seeking salvation\\nthrough intense devotion and love for God by following\\nHis commands, and by following the example of the\\nProphet Muhammad whom they regarded as a perfect\\nhuman being. The sufis thus sought an interpretation\\nof the Qur’an on the basis of their personal experience.\\n6.1 Khanqahs and silsilas\\nBy the eleventh century Sufism evolved into a well-\\ndeveloped movement with a body of literature on\\nQuranic studies and sufi practices. Institutionally,\\nthe sufis began to organise communities around the\\nhospice or khanqah  (Persian) controlled by a teaching\\nmaster known as shaikh  (in Arabic), pir or murshid (in\\nPersian) . He enrolled disciples ( murids ) and appointed\\na successor ( khalifa ). He established rules for spiritual\\nconduct and interaction between inmates as well as\\nbetween laypersons and the master .\\nSufi silsila s began to crystallise in different parts of\\nthe Islamic world around the twelfth century. The word\\nsilsila  literally  means a chain, signifying a continuous\\nlink between master and disciple, stretching as an\\nunbroken spiritual genealogy to the Prophet Muhammad.\\nIt was through this channel that spiritual power and\\nblessings were transmitted to devotees. Special rituals\\nof initiation were developed in which initiates took an\\noath of allegiance, wore a patched garment, and shaved\\ntheir hair .\\nWhen the shaikh  died, his tomb-shrine ( dargah, a\\nPersian term meaning court) became the centre of\\ndevotion for his followers. This encouraged the practice\\nof pilgrimage  or ziyarat  to his grave, particularly on\\nhis death anniversary or urs  (or marriage, signifying\\nthe union of his soul with God). This was because\\npeople believed that in death saints were united with\\nGod, and were thus closer to Him than when living.\\nPeople sought their blessings to attain material and\\nspiritual benefits. Thus evolved the cult of the shaikh\\nrevered as wali.Sufism and tasawwuf\\nSufism is an English word\\ncoined in the nineteenth\\ncentury . The wor d used for\\nSufism in Islamic texts is\\ntasawwuf . Historians have\\nunderstood this term in\\nseveral ways. According to\\nsome scholars, it is derived\\nfrom suf, meaning wool,\\nreferring to the coarse\\nwoollen clothes worn by\\nsufis.  Others derive it from\\nsafa,  meaning purity . It may\\nalso have been derived from\\nsuffa, the platform outside\\nthe Prophet’s mosque,\\nwhere a group of close\\nfollowers assembled to learn\\nabout the faith.\\nNames of  silsilas\\nMost sufi lineages were\\nnamed after a founding\\nfigure. For example, the\\nQadiri order was named\\nafter Shaikh Abd’ul Qadir\\nJilani.

Many scorned\\nthe khanqah  and took to mendicancy and observed\\ncelibacy. They ignored rituals and observed extreme\\nforms of asceticism. They were known by different\\nnames – Qalandars, Madaris, Malangs, Haidaris,\\netc. Because of their deliberate defiance of the shari‘a\\nthey were often referred to as be-shari‘ a, in contrast\\nto the ba-shari‘a sufis who complied with it.\\n7.

However , this was by no means a situation of\\nabsolute isolation fr om political power . The sufis\\naccepted unsolicited grants and donations from the\\npolitical elites. The Sultans in turn set up charitable\\ntrusts ( auqa f) as endowments for  hospices and\\ngranted tax-free land ( inam ).\\nThe Chishtis accepted donations in cash and kind.\\nRather than accumulate donations, they preferred\\nto use these fully on immediate requirements\\nsuch as food, clothes, living quarters and ritual\\nnecessities (such as sama ‘). All this enhanced the\\nmoral authority of the shaikhs, which in turn\\nattracted people fr om all walks of life. Further , their\\npiety and scholarship, and people’s belief in their\\nmiraculous powers made sufis popular among the\\nmasses, whose support kings wished to secure.\\nKings did not simply need to demonstrate their\\nassociation with sufis; they also required legitimation\\nfrom them. When the Turks set up the Delhi\\nSultanate, they resisted the  insistence of the ulama\\non imposing shari‘a  as state law because they\\nanticipated opposition from their subjects, the\\nmajority of whom were non-Muslims. The Sultans\\nthen sought out the sufis – who derived their\\nauthority directly from God – and  did not depend on\\njurists to interpret the shari‘a .\\nBesides, it was believed that the auliya could\\nintercede with God in order to improve the material\\nand spiritual conditions of ordinary human beings.\\nThis explains why kings often wanted their tombs to\\nbe in the vicinity of sufi shrines and hospices.\\nHowever , ther e wer e instances of conflict between\\nthe Sultans and the sufis. To assert their authority,\\nboth expected that certain rituals be performed such\\nas prostration and kissing of the feet. Occasionally\\nthe sufi shaikh was addressed with high-sounding\\ntitles.

Such exercises have\\nproved to be challenging on a number of counts.\\nVerses ascribed to Kabir have been compiled in\\nthree distinct but overlapping traditions. The Kabir\\nBijak is preserved by the Kabirpanth (the path or\\nsect of Kabir) in V aranasi and elsewher e in Uttar\\nPradesh; the Kabir Granthavali is associated with\\nthe Dadupanth in Rajasthan, and many of his\\ncompositions are found in the Adi Granth Sahib (see\\nSection 8.2). All these manuscript compilations\\nwere made long after the death of Kabir . By the\\nnineteenth century, anthologies of verses attributed\\nto him circulated in print in regions as far apart as\\nBengal, Gujarat and Maharashtra.\\nKabir’s poems have survived in several languages\\nand dialects; and some are composed in the special\\nlanguage  of nirguna  poets, the sant bhasha . Others,\\nknown as ulatbansi  (upside-down sayings), are\\nwritten in a form in which everyday meanings\\nare inverted. These hint at the difficulties of\\ncapturing the nature of the Ultimate Reality in\\nwords: expressions such as “the lotus which blooms\\nwithout flower” or the “fire raging in the ocean” convey\\na sense of Kabir’s mystical experiences.\\nAlso striking is the range of traditions Kabir drew\\non to describe the Ultimate Reality. These include\\nIslam: he described the Ultimate Reality as Allah,\\nKhuda, Hazrat and Pir . He also used ter ms drawn\\nfrom V edantic traditions, alakh (the unseen), nirakar\\n(formless), Brahman, Atman, etc. Other terms with\\nmystical connotations such as shabda (sound) or\\nshunya (emptiness) were drawn from yogic traditions.The One Lord\\nHere is a composition attributed\\nto Kabir:\\nTell me, br other , how can\\nthere be\\nNo one lord of the world\\nbut two?\\nWho led you so astray?\\nGod is called by many names:\\nNames like Allah, Ram,  Karim,\\nKeshav , Hari, and Hazrat.\\nGold may be shaped into\\nrings and bangles.\\nIsn’t it gold all the same?\\nDistinctions are only words\\nwe invent …\\nKabir says they are both\\nmistaken.\\nNeither can find the only\\nRam.

W e may never\\nbe able to tell with certainty, although scholars have\\ntried to analyse the language, style and content to\\nestablish which verses could be Kabir’s. What this\\nrich corpus of verses also signifies is that Kabir was\\nand is to the present a source of inspiration for\\nthose who questioned entrenched religious and\\nsocial institutions, ideas and practices in their\\nsearch for the Divine.\\nJust as Kabir’s ideas probably\\ncrystallised through dialogue\\nand debate (explicit or implicit)\\nwith the traditions of sufis and\\nyogis in the region of Awadh (part\\nof present-day Uttar Pradesh),\\nhis legacy was claimed by several\\ngroups, who remembered him\\nand continue to do so.\\nThis is most evident in later\\ndebates about whether he was\\na Hindu or a Muslim by birth,\\ndebates that are reflected in\\nhagiographies. Many of these\\nwere composed from the\\nseventeenth century onwards,\\nabout 200 years after Kabir’s\\nlifetime.\\nHagiographies within the\\nVaishnava tradition attempted\\nto suggest that he was born a\\nHindu, Kabirdas (Kabir itself is\\nan Arabic word meaning “great”),\\nbut was raised by a poor\\nMuslim family belonging to\\nthe community of weavers or\\njulahas, who were relatively\\nrecent converts to Islam.

He firmly\\nrepudiated the external practices of the religions he\\nsaw around him. He rejected sacrifices, ritual baths,\\nimage worship, austerities and the scriptures of both\\nHindus and Muslims. For Baba Guru Nanak,\\nthe Absolute or “ rab” had no gender or form. He\\nproposed a simple way to connect to the Divine by\\nremembering and repeating the Divine Name,\\nexpressing his ideas through hymns called “ shabad ”\\nin Punjabi, the language of the region.

Reconstructing Histories of\\nReligious Traditions\\nWe have seen that historians draw on a variety\\nof sources to reconstruct histories of religious\\ntraditions – these include sculpture, architecture,\\nstories  about religious preceptors, compositions\\nattributed to women and men engaged in the quest\\nof understanding the nature of the Divine.\\nAs we have seen in Chapters 1 and 4, sculpture\\nand architecture can only be understood if we\\nhave a grasp of the context – the ideas, beliefs and\\npractices of those who produced and used these\\nimages and buildings. What about textual traditions\\nregarding religious beliefs? If you return to the\\nsources in this chapter , you will notice that they\\ninclude a wide variety, written in several different\\nlanguages and styles. They range from the\\napparently simple, direct language of the vachanas\\nof Basavanna to the or nate Persian of the farman of\\nthe Mughal emperors. Understanding each type of\\ntext requires different skills: apart from a familiarity\\nwith several languages, the historian has to be aware\\nof the subtle variations in style that characterise\\neach genre.Shankaradeva\\nIn the late fifteenth century ,\\nShankaradeva emerged as one\\nof the leading proponents of\\nVaishnavism in Assam. His\\nteachings, often known as the\\nBhagavati dharma because they\\nwere based on the Bhagavad\\nGita and the Bhagavata Purana,\\nfocused on absolute surrender\\nto the supr eme deity , in this case\\nVishnu. He emphasised the\\nneed for naam kirtan, recitation\\nof the names of the lord in sat\\nsanga  or congregations of pious\\ndevotees. He also encouraged\\nthe establishment of satra  or\\nmonasteries for the transmission\\nof spiritual knowledge, and\\nnaam ghar  or prayer halls.\\nMany of these institutions and\\npractices continue to flourish\\nin the region. His major\\ncompositions include the\\nKirtana-ghosha.BHAKT I-SUFI TRADITIONS\\n2024-25\\n THEMES  IN INDIAN H ISTORY  – P ART II 166\\nVarieties of sources used to reconstruct\\nthe history of sufi traditions\\nA wide range of texts were produced in and around sufi khanqahs.\\nThese included:\\n1.Treatises or manuals dealing with sufi thought and\\npractices – The Kashf-ul-Mahjub  of Ali bin Usman Hujwiri (died\\nc. 1071) is an example of this genre. It enables historians to see\\nhow traditions outside the subcontinent influenced sufi thought\\nin India.\\n2. Malfuzat (literally ,  “utter ed”; conversations of sufi saints) –\\nAn early te xt on malfuzat  is the Fawa’id-al-F u’ad , a collection of\\nconversations of Shaikh Nizamuddin Auliya, compiled by Amir\\nHasan Sijzi Dehlavi, a noted Persian poet. Source 9 contains an\\nexcerpt from this text. Malfuzats were compiled by different sufi\\nsilsilas  with the permission of the shaikhs ; these had obvious\\ndidactic purposes. Several examples have been found from\\ndifferent parts of the subcontinent, including the Deccan. They\\nwere compiled over several centuries.\\n3. Maktubat  (literally , “written ” collections of letters); letters\\nwritten by sufi masters, addressed to their disciples and\\nassociates – While these tell us about the shaikh’s  experience\\nof religious truth that he wanted to share with others, they\\nalso reflect  the life conditions of the recipients and are responses\\nto their aspirations and difficulties, both spiritual and mundane.\\nThe letters, known as  Maktubat-i Imam Rabbani , of the noted\\nseventeenth-century Naqshbandi Shaikh Ahmad Sirhindi\\n(d.1624), whose ideology is often contrasted with the liberal\\nand non -sectarian views of Akbar , are amongst those most\\nfrequently discussed by scholars.\\n4. Tazkiras  (literally , “to mention and memorialise”; biographical\\naccounts of saints) – The fourteenth-century Siyar-ul-Auliya  of\\nMir Khwurd Kirmani was the first sufi tazkira  written in India.\\nIt dealt principally with the Chishti saints. The most famous tazkira\\nis the Akhbar-ul-Akhyar of Abdul Haqq Muhaddis Dehlavi\\n(d. 1642). The authors of the tazkiras  often sought to establish\\nthe precedence of their own orders and glorify their  spiritual\\ngenealogies. Many details are often implausible, full of elements\\nof the fantastic. Still they are of great value for historians and\\nhelp them to understand more fully the nature of the tradition.\\n Remember that each of the traditions we have been considering\\nin this chapter generated a wide range of textual and oral modes\\nof communication, some of which have been preserved, many\\nof which have been modified in the process of transmission, and\\nothers ar e probably lost for ever.\\n2024-25\\n167\\nVirtually all these religious traditions continue to\\nflourish to date. This continuity has certain\\nadvantages for historians as it allows them to compare\\ncontemporary practices with those described in textual\\ntraditions or shown in old paintings  and to trace\\nchanges.  At the same time, because these traditions\\nare part of peoples’ lived beliefs and practices, there\\nis often a lack of acceptance of the possibility that\\nthese may have changed over time.  The challenge for\\nhistorians is to undertake such investigations with\\nsensitivity, while at the same time recognising that\\nreligious traditions, like other traditions, are dynamic\\nand change over time.\\nTimeline\\nSome  Major  Religious  Teac her s in the Subcontinent\\nc. 500-800 CE Appar , Sambandar , Sundaramurti in T amil Nadu\\nc. 800-900 Nammalvar , Manikkavachakar , Andal, T ondaradippodi\\nin Tamil Nadu\\nc.1000 -1100 Al Hujwiri, Data Ganj Bakhsh in the Punjab; Ramanujacharya\\nin Tamil Nadu\\nc.1100 -1200 Basavanna in Karnataka\\nc.1200 -1300 Jnanadeva, Muktabai in Maharashtra; Khwaja Muinuddin\\nChishti in Rajasthan; Bahauddin Zakariyya and Fariduddin\\nGanj- i Shakar in the Punjab; Qutbuddin Bakhtiyar Kaki in Delhi\\nc.1300 -1400 Lal Ded in Kashmir; Lal Shahbaz Qalandar in Sind;\\nNizamuddin Auliya in Delhi; Ramananda in Uttar Pradesh;\\nChokhamela in Maharashtra; Sharafuddin Yahya Maneri in Bihar\\nc.1400 -1500 Kabir , Raidas, Sur das in  Uttar Pradesh; Baba Guru Nanak in the\\nPunjab; V allabhacharya in Gujarat; Abdullah Shattari in Gwalior;\\nMuhammad Shah Alam in Gujarat; Mir Sayyid Muhammad Gesu\\nDaraz in Gulbarga,  Shankaradeva in Assam; Tukaram in\\nMaharashtra\\nc.1500 -1600 Sri Chaitanya in Bengal; Mirabai in Rajasthan; Shaikh Abdul\\nQuddus Gangohi, Malik Muhammad Jaisi, Tulsidas in\\nUttar  Pradesh\\nc.1600 -1700 Shaikh Ahmad Sirhindi in Haryana; Miyan Mir in the Punjab\\nNote: These time frames indicate the approximate period during which these teachers lived.BHAKT I-SUFI TRADITIONS\\n2024-25\\n THEMES  IN INDIAN H ISTORY  – P ART II 168\\nAnsw er in1 00-150 w ords\\n1.Explain with examples what historians mean by the\\nintegration of cults.\\n2.To what extent do you think the architecture of\\nmosques in the subcontinent reflects a combination\\nof universal ideals and local traditions?\\n3.What were the similarities and differences between\\nthe be-shari‘a and ba-shari‘a sufi traditions?\\n4.Discuss the ways in which the Alvars, Nayanars and\\nVirashaivas expressed critiques of the caste system.\\n5.Describe the major teachings of either Kabir or\\nBaba Guru Nanak, and the ways in which these\\nhave been transmitted.\\nWrite a shor\\nt essa y (about\\n250-300 words) on the following:\\n6.Discuss the major beliefs and practices that\\ncharacterised Sufism.\\n7.Examine how and why rulers tried to establish\\nconnections with the traditions of the Nayanars and\\nthe sufis.\\n8.Analyse, with illustrations, why bhakti and sufi\\nthinkers adopted a variety of languages in which\\nto express their opinions.\\n9.Read any five of the sources included in this chapter\\nand discuss the social and religious ideas that are\\nexpressed in them.\\nMap work\\n10.On an outline map of India, plot three major sufi\\nshrines, and three places associated with temples\\n(one each of a form of Vishnu, Shiva and the\\ngoddess).\\n2024-25\\n169\\nRichard M.

The empire was founded\\nin the fourteenth century. In its heyday it stretched\\nfrom the river Krishna in the north to the extreme\\nsouth of the peninsula. In 1565 the city was sacked\\nand subsequently deserted. Although it fell into\\nruin in the seventeenth-eighteenth centuries, it\\nlived on in the memories of people living in the\\nKrishna-Tungabhadra doab. They remembered it\\nas Hampi, a name derived from that of the local\\nmother goddess, Pampadevi. These oral traditions\\ncombined with archaeological finds, monuments\\nand inscriptions and other records helped scholars\\nto rediscover the Vijayanagara Empire.\\n1. The Disco very of Ham pi\\nThe ruins at Hampi were brought to light in 1800 by\\nan engineer and antiquarian named Colonel Colin\\nMackenzie. An employee of the English East India\\nCompany, he prepared the first survey map of the\\nsite. Much of the initial information he received was\\nbased on the memories of priests of the Virupaksha\\ntemple and the shrine of Pampadevi. Subsequently,\\nfrom 1856, photographers began to record the\\nmonuments which enabled scholars to study them.\\nAs early as 1836 epigraphists began collecting\\nseveral dozen inscriptions found at this and other\\ntemples at Hampi. In an effort to reconstruct the\\nhistory of the city and the empire, historians collated\\ninformation from these sources with accounts of\\nforeign travellers and other literature written in\\nTelugu, Kannada, Tamil and Sanskrit.Fig. 7.1\\nA part of the stone wall that was\\nbuilt around the city of VijayanagaraTHEME\\nSEVEN\\n2024-25\\n171\\nColin Mackenzie\\nBorn in 1754, Colin Mackenzie became famous as an\\nengineer , surveyor and cartographer .

He says that “it struggled long under\\nthe miseries of bad management … before the South\\ncame under the benign influence of the British\\ngovernment”. By studying Vijayanagara, Mackenzie\\nbelieved that the East India Company could gain “much\\nuseful information on many of these institutions, laws\\nand customs whose influence still prevails among the\\nvarious T ribes of Natives forming the general mass of\\nthe population to this day”.\\n2.

Ruling elites\\nin these areas had extended patronage to elaborate\\ntemples such as the Brihadishvara temple at\\nThanjavur and the Chennakeshava temple at Belur .\\nThe rulers of Vijayanagara, who called themselves\\nrayas , built on these traditions and carried them,\\nas we will see, literally to new heights.\\n2.1 Kings and traders\\nAs warfare during these times depended upon\\neffective cavalry, the import of horses from Arabia\\nand Central Asia was very important for rival\\nkingdoms. This trade was initially controlled by Arab\\ntraders. Local communities of merchants known as\\nkudirai chettis  or horse merchants also participated\\nin these exchanges. From 1498 other actors appeared\\non the scene. These were the Portuguese, who arrived\\non the west coast of the subcontinent and attempted\\nto establish trading and military stations. Their\\nsuperior military technology, especially the use of\\nmuskets, enabled them to become important players\\nin the tangled politics of the period.\\nIn fact, Vijayanagara was also noted for its\\nmarkets dealing in spices, textiles and precious\\nstones. T rade was often r egarded as a status symbol\\nfor such cities, which boasted of a wealthy population\\nthat demanded high-value exotic goods, especially\\nprecious stones and jewellery.

The first dynasty, known as the\\nSangama dynasty, exercised control till 1485.\\nThey were supplanted by the Saluvas, military\\ncommanders, who remained in power till 1503\\nwhen they were replaced by the Tuluvas.\\nKrishnadeva Raya belonged to the Tuluva dynasty.\\nKrishnadeva Raya’s rule was characterised by\\nexpansion and consolidation. This was the time\\nwhen the land between the Tungabhadra and\\nKrishna rivers (the Raichur doab) was acquired\\n(1512), the rulers of Orissa were subdued (1514) and\\nsevere defeats were inflicted on the Sultan of Bijapur\\n(1520). Although the kingdom remained in a constant\\nstate of military preparedness, it flourished under\\nconditions of unparalleled peace and prosperity.\\nKrishnadeva Raya is credited with building some\\nfine temples and adding impressive gopurams  to\\nmany important south Indian temples. He also\\nfounded a suburban township near Vijayanagara\\ncalled Nagalapuram after his mother . Some of the\\nmost detailed descriptions of Vijayanagara come from\\nhis time or just after .\\nStrain began to show within the imperial structure\\nfollowing Krishnadeva Raya’s death in 1529. His\\nsuccessors were troubled by rebellious nayakas  or\\nmilitary chiefs. By 1542 control at the centre had\\nshifted to another ruling lineage, that of the Aravidu,\\nwhich remained in power till the end of the\\nseventeenth century. During this period, as indeed\\nearlier , the military ambitions of the rulers\\nof Vijayanagara as well as those of the Deccan\\nSultanates resulted in shifting alignments.\\nEventually this led to an alliance of the Sultanates\\nagainst Vijayanagara.

They retained\\npart of the revenue for personal use and for\\nmaintaining a stipulated contingent of horses\\nand elephants. These contingents provided the\\nVijayanagara kings with an effective fighting force\\nwith which they brought the entire southern\\npeninsula under their control. Some of the revenue\\nwas also used for the maintenance of temples and\\nirrigation works.\\nThe amara-nayakas  sent tribute to the king\\nannually and personally appeared in the royal court\\nwith gifts to express their loyalty. Kings occasionally\\nasserted their control over them by transferring them\\nfrom one place to another .

Several\\ntravellers visited the city and\\nwrote about it. Notable among\\ntheir accounts are those of an\\nItalian trader named Nicolo de\\nConti, an ambassador named\\nAbdur Razzaq sent by the ruler\\nof Persia, a merchant named\\nAfanasii Nikitin from Russia,\\nall of whom visited the city in\\nthe fifteenth century , and those\\nof Duarte Barbosa, Domingo\\nPaes and F ernao Nuniz fr om\\nPortugal, who came in the\\nsixteenth century .\\n2024-25\\n177\\n3.1 W ater r esour ces\\nThe most striking feature about the location of\\nVijayanagara is the natural basin formed by the\\nriver Tungabhadra which flows in a north-easterly\\ndirection. The surrounding landscape is characterised\\nby stunning granite hills that seem to form a girdle\\naround the city. A number of streams flow down to\\nthe river from these rocky outcrops .\\nIn almost all cases embankments were built along\\nthese streams to create reservoirs of varying sizes.\\nAs this is one of the most arid zones of the peninsula,\\nelaborate arrangements had to be made to store\\nrainwater and conduct it to the city. The most\\nimportant such tank was built in the early years\\nof the fifteenth century and is now called\\nKamalapuram tank. W ater fr om this tank not only\\nirrigated fields nearby but was also conducted\\nthrough a channel to the “royal centre”.\\nOne of the most prominent waterworks to be seen\\namong the ruins is the Hiriya canal. This canal drew\\nwater from a dam across the Tungabhadra and\\nirrigated the cultivated valley that separated the\\n“sacred centre” from the “urban core”. This was\\napparently built by kings of the Sangama dynasty.\\n3.2 Fortifications and roads\\nBefore we examine the different parts of the city in\\ndetail let us look at what enclosed them all –  the\\ngreat fortress walls. Abdur Razzaq, an ambassador\\nsent by the ruler of Persia to Calicut (present-day\\nKozhikode) in the fifteenth century, was greatly\\nimpressed by the fortifications, and mentioned\\nseven lines of forts. These encircled not only the\\ncity but also its agricultural hinterland and forests.\\nThe outermost wall linked the hills surrounding\\nthe city. The massive masonry construction was\\nslightly tapered.\\xa0 No mortar or cementing agent was\\nemployed anywhere in the construction. The stone\\nblocks were wedge shaped, which held them in\\nplace, and the inner portion of the walls was of\\nearth packed with rubble. Square or rectangular\\nbastions projected outwards.\\nWhat was most significant about this fortification\\nis that it enclosed agricultural tracts. Abdur Razzaq\\nnoted tha t“between the first, second and the third\\nwalls there are cultivated fields, gardens and houses”.\\nAnd Paes observed: “From this first circuit until youFig. 7.5\\nAn aqueduct leading into the royal\\ncentreHow tanks were built\\nAbout a tank constructed by\\nKrishnadeva Raya, Paes wrote:\\nThe king made a tank … at\\nthe mouth of two hills\\nso that all the water\\nwhich comes from either\\none side or the other\\ncollects  there; and, besides\\nthis, water comes to it\\nfrom more than three\\nleagues (approximately 15\\nkilometres) by pipes which\\nrun along the lower parts of\\nthe range outside.

This tract was serviced\\nby an elaborate canal system drawing water from\\nthe Tungabhadra.\\nWhy do you think agricultural tracts were\\nincorporated within the fortified area? Often, the\\nobjective of medieval sieges was to starve the\\ndefenders into submission. These sieges could last\\nfor several months and sometimes even years.\\nNormally rulers tried to be prepared for such\\nsituations by building large granaries within\\nfortified areas. The rulers of Vijayanagara adopted\\na more expensive and elaborate strategy of protecting\\nthe agricultural belt itself.\\nA second line of fortification went round the\\ninner core of the urban complex, and a third line\\nsurrounded the royal centre, within which each set\\nof major buildings was surrounded by its own\\nhigh walls.\\nThe fort was entered through well-guarded gates,\\nwhich linked the city to the major roads. Gateways\\nwere distinctive architectural features that often\\ndefined the structures to which they regulated\\naccess. The arch on the gateway leading into the\\nfortified settlement as well as the dome over the\\ngate (Fig. 7.6) are regarded as typical features of the\\narchitecture introduced by the Turkish Sultans. Art\\nhistorians refer to this style as Indo-Islamic, as it\\ngrew continually through interaction with local\\nbuilding practices in different regions.\\nArchaeologists have studied roads within the city\\nand those leading out from it. These have been\\nidentified by tracing paths through gateways, as well\\nas by finds of pavements. Roads generally wound\\naround through the valleys, avoiding rocky terrain.\\nSome of the most important roads extended from\\ntemple gateways, and were lined by bazaars.\\n3.3 The urban core\\nMoving along the roads leading into the urban core,\\nthere is relatively little archaeological evidence of\\nthe houses of ordinary people. Archaeologists haveFig. 7.6\\nA gateway in the fortification wall\\nFig. 7.7\\nA gopuram/circleright Describe the similarities\\nand differences between\\nthese two entrances.\\nWhy do you think the rulers\\nof Vijayanagara adopted\\nelements of Indo-Islamic\\narchitecture?\\n2024-25\\n179\\nfound fine Chinese porcelain in some areas,\\nincluding in the north-eastern corner of the urban\\ncore and suggest that these areas may have been\\noccupied by rich traders. This was also the Muslim\\nresidential quarter . Tombs and mosques located\\nhere have distinctive functions, yet their architecture\\nresembles that of the mandapas  found in the temples\\nof Hampi.\\nThis is how the sixteenth-century Portuguese\\ntraveller Barbosa described the houses of ordinary\\npeople, which have not survived: “The other houses\\nof the people are thatched, but nonetheless well built\\nand arranged according to occupations, in long\\nstreets with many open places.”\\nField surveys indicate that the entire area was\\ndotted with numerous shrines and small temples,\\npointing to the prevalence of a variety of cults,\\nperhaps supported by different communities. The\\nsurveys also indicate that wells, rainwater tanks as\\nwell as temple tanks may have served as sources of\\nwater to the ordinary town dwellers.\\n4.  The R oyal Centr e\\nThe royal centre was located in the south-western\\npart of the settlement. Although designated as a royal\\ncentre, it included over 60 temples. Clearly, the\\npatronage of temples and cults was important for\\nrulers who were trying to establish and legitimise\\ntheir authority through association with the\\ndivinities housed in the shrines.\\nAbout thirty building complexes have been\\nidentified as palaces.

One difference between\\nthese structures and temples is that the latter\\nwere constructed entirely of masonry, while the\\nsuperstructure of the secular buildings was made\\nof perishable materials.\\n4.1 The mahanavami dibba\\nSome of the more distinctive structures in the area\\nhave been assigned names based on the form of\\nthe buildings as well as their functions. The “king’s\\npalace” is the largest of the enclosures but has not\\nyielded definitive evidence of being a royal residence.\\nIt has two of the most impressive platforms, usually\\ncalled the “audience hall” and the “mahanavami\\ndibba” . The entire complex is surrounded by high\\ndouble walls with a street running between them.\\nThe audience hall is a high platform with slots for\\nwooden pillars at close and regular intervals. It had\\na stair case going up to the second floor , which r ested\\non these pillars. The pillars being closely spaced,\\nwould have left little free space and thus it is not\\nclear what the hall was used for .\\nLocated on one of the highest points in the city,\\nthe “ mahanavami dibba”  is a massive platform rising\\nfrom a base of about 11,000 sq. ft to a height of\\n40 ft. There is evidence that it supported a wooden\\nstructure. The base of the platform is covered with\\nrelief carvings (Fig. 7.12).\\nRituals associated with the structure probably\\ncoincided with Mahanavami (literally, the great ninth\\nday) of the ten-day Hindu festival during the autumn\\nmonths of September and October , known variously\\nas Dusehra (northern India), Durga Puja (in Bengal)Fig. 7.11\\nThe mahanavami dibbaA House of Victory?\\nThis is what Paes had to say\\nabout the audience hall and\\nthe mahanavami dibba , which\\ntogether he called the “House\\nof Victory”:\\nThese buildings have\\ntwo platforms one above\\nthe other , beautifully\\nsculpted … On the upper\\nplatform … in this House\\nof Victory the king has a\\nroom made of cloth …\\nwhere the idol has a shrine\\n... and in the other in the\\nmiddle is placed a dais on\\nwhich stands a throne of\\nstate,  (the crown and the\\nroyal anklet) …\\nFig. 7.12\\nCarvings on the mahanavami\\ndibba\\n/circleright Can you identify the themes\\nof the carvings?\\n2024-25\\n181\\nand Navaratri or Mahanavami (in peninsular India).\\nThe Vijayanagara kings displayed their  prestige, power\\nand suzerainty on this occasion.\\nThe ceremonies performed on the occasion included\\nworship of the image, worship of the state horse, and\\nthe sacrifice of buffaloes and other animals. Dances,\\nwrestling matches, and processions of caparisoned\\nhorses, elephants and chariots and soldiers, as well\\nas ritual presentations before the king and his\\nguests by the chief nayakas  and subordinate kings\\nmarked the occasion. These ceremonies were imbued\\nwith deep symbolic meanings. On the last day of the\\nfestival the king inspected his army and the armies\\nof the nayakas  in a grand ceremony in an open field.\\nOn this occasion the nayakas  brought rich gifts for\\nthe king as well as the stipulated tribute.\\nWas the “ mahanavami dibba” that stands today\\nthe centre of this elaborate ritual? Scholars have\\npointed out that the space surrounding the structure\\ndoes not seem to have been adequate for elaborate\\nprocessions of armed men, women, and large\\nnumbers of animals. Like some of the other\\nstructures in the royal centre, it remains an enigma.\\n4.2 Other buildings in the royal centre\\nOne of the most beautiful buildings in the royal\\ncentre is the Lotus Mahal, so named by British\\ntravellers in the nineteenth century.

The Sacred Centre\\n5.1 Choosing a capital\\nWe now move to the r ocky norther n end of the city\\non the banks of the Tungabhadra. According to local\\ntradition, these hills sheltered the monkey kingdom\\nof Vali and Sugriva mentioned in the Ramayana .\\nOther traditions suggest that Pampadevi, the local\\nmother goddess, did penance in these hills in order\\nto marry Virupaksha, the guardian deity of the\\nkingdom, also recognised as a form of Shiva. To this\\nday this marriage is celebrated annually in the\\nVirupaksha temple. Among these hills are found\\nJaina temples of the pre-Vijayanagara period as well.\\nIn other words, this area was associated with several\\nsacred traditions.\\nTemple building in the region had a long history,\\ngoing back to dynasties such as the Pallavas,\\nChalukyas, Hoysalas and Cholas. Rulers very often\\nencouraged temple building as a means of\\nassociating themselves with the divine – often, the\\ndeity was explicitly or implicitly identified with the\\nking. Temples also functioned as centres of learning.\\nBesides, rulers and others often granted land and\\nother resources for the maintenance of temples.\\nConsequently, temples developed as significant\\nreligious, social, cultural and economic centres. From\\nthe point of view of the rulers, constructing, repairing\\nand maintaining temples were important means\\nof winning support and r ecognition for their power ,\\nwealth and piety.\\nIt is likely that the very choice of the site of\\nVijayanagara was inspired by the existence of the\\nshrines of Virupaksha and Pampadevi. In fact the\\nVijayanagara kings claimed to rule on behalf of\\nthe god Virupaksha. All royal orders were signed\\n“Shri  Virupaksha”,  usually in the Kannada script.\\nRulers also indicated their close links with the gods\\nby using the title “Hindu Suratrana ”. This was a\\nSanskritisation of the Arabic term Sultan, meaning\\nking, so it literally meant Hindu Sultan.\\nEven as they drew on earlier traditions, the rulers\\nof Vijayanagara innovated and developed these.\\nRoyal portrait sculpture was now displayed in\\ntemples, and the king’s visits to temples were treated\\nas important state occasions on which he was\\naccompanied by the important nayakas  of the empire.\\n2024-25\\n185\\n5.2. Gopurams  and mandapas\\nIn terms of temple architecture, by this period\\ncertain new features were in evidence. These\\nincluded structures of immense scale that must have\\nbeen a mark of imperial authority, best exemplified\\nby the raya gopurams  (Fig. 7.7) or royal gateways\\nthat often dwarfed the towers on the central shrines,\\nand signalled the presence of the temple from a great\\nFig. 7.20\\nAn aerial view of the\\nVirupaksha temple\\nFig. 7.21\\nA plan of the Virupaksha\\ntemple\\nMost of the square\\nstructures are shrines.\\nThe two major gateways\\nare shaded in black.\\nEach tiny dot represents\\na pillar .

They were also probably meant as\\nreminders of the power of kings, able to command\\nthe resources, techniques and skills needed to\\nconstruct these towering gateways. Other distinctive\\nfeatures include mandapas or pavilions and\\nlong, pillared corridors that often ran around the\\nshrines within the temple complex. Let us look at\\ntwo temples more closely – the Virupaksha temple\\nand the Vitthala temple.\\nThe Virupaksha temple was built over centuries.\\nWhile inscriptions suggest that the earliest\\nshrine dated to the ninth-tenth centuries, it was\\nsubstantially enlarged with the establishment\\nof the Vijayanagara Empire. The hall in front of\\nthe main shrine was built by Krishnadeva Raya to\\nmark his accession. This was decorated with\\ndelicately carved pillars.

These\\nadditions meant that the central shrine came to\\noccupy a relatively small part of the complex.\\nThe halls in the temple were used for a variety of\\npurposes. Some were spaces in which the images of\\ngods were placed to witness special programmes of\\nmusic, dance, drama, etc. Others were used to\\ncelebrate the marriages of deities, and yet others\\nwere meant for the deities to swing in. Special images,\\ndistinct from those kept in the small central shrine,\\nwere used on these occasions.\\nFig. 7.24\\nThe chariot of the Vitthala temple\\n/circleright Do you think chariots\\nwould have actually been built\\nlike this?\\nFig. 7.25\\nSwing pavilion from GingeeAN IMPERIAL C APITAL: VIJAYANAG ARA\\n2024-25\\n THEMES  IN INDIAN H ISTORY  – P ART II 188\\nAnother shrine, the Vitthala temple, is also\\ninteresting. Here, the principal deity was Vitthala, a\\nform of Vishnu generally worshipped in Maharashtra.\\nThe introduction of the worship of the deity in\\nKarnataka is another indication of the ways in which\\nthe rulers of Vijayanagara drew on different traditions\\nto create an imperial culture. As in the case of other\\ntemples, this temple too has several halls and a\\nunique shrine designed as a chariot (Fig. 7.2 4).\\nA characteristic feature of the temple complexes\\nis the chariot streets that extended from the temple\\ngopuram  in a straight line. These streets were paved\\nwith stone slabs and lined with pillared pavilions in\\nwhich merchants set up their shops.\\nJust as the nayakas continued with and elaborated\\non traditions of fortification, so they did with\\ntraditions of temple building. In fact, some of the\\nmost spectacular gopurams were also built by the\\nlocal nayakas.\\n/circleright Discuss...\\nHow and why did the rulers of Vijayanagara adopt\\nand adapt earlier traditions of ritual architecture?\\n6. Plo tting P alaces, T emples\\nand Bazaars\\nWe have been examining a wealth of infor mation on\\nVijayanagara – photographs, plans, elevations of\\nstructures and sculpture. How was all of this\\nproduced? After the initial surveys by Mackenzie,\\ninformation was pieced together from travellers’\\naccounts and inscriptions. Through the twentieth\\ncentury, the site was preserved by the Archaeological\\nSurvey of India and the Karnataka Department of\\nArchaeology and Museums. In 1976, Hampi was\\nrecognised as a site of national importance. Then,\\nin the early 1980s, an important project was\\nlaunched to document the material remains at\\nVijayanagara in detail, through extensive and\\nintensive surveys, using a variety of recording\\ntechniques. Over nearly twenty years, dozens ofFig. 7.26\\nA gopuram built by the nayakas\\nof Madurai\\n2024-25\\n189\\nscholars from all over the\\nworld worked to compile and\\npreserve this information.\\nLet us look at just one\\npart of this enormous\\nexercise – mapping – in\\nmore detail.

       "  'text': ' THEMES IN INDIAN HISTORY – PART  II 196\\nDuring the sixteenth and seventeenth centuries\\nabout 85 per cent of the population of India lived in\\nits villages. Both peasants and landed elites were\\ninvolved in agricultural production and claimed\\nrights to a share of the produce. This created\\nrelationships of cooperation, competition and\\nconflict among them. The sum of these agrarian\\nrelationships made up rural society.\\nAt the same time agencies from outside also\\nentered into the rural world. Most important among\\nthese was the Mughal state, which derived the\\nbulk of its income from agricultural production.\\nAgents of the state – revenue assessors, collectors,\\nrecord keepers – sought to control rural society so\\nas to ensure that cultivation took place and the\\nstate got its regular share of taxes from the\\nproduce. Since many crops were grown for sale,\\ntrade, money and markets entered the villages and\\nlinked the agricultural areas with the towns.\\n1. Peasants and A gricultur al\\nProduction\\nThe basic unit of agricultural society was the village,\\ninhabited by peasants who performed the manifold\\nseasonal tasks that made up agricultural production\\nthroughout the year – tilling the soil, sowing  seeds,\\nharvesting the cr op when it was ripe. Further , they\\ncontributed their labour to the production of\\nagro-based goods such as sugar and oil.\\nBut rural India was not characterised by settled\\npeasant production alone.

Our major source for\\nthe agrarian history of the sixteenth and early\\nseventeenth centuries are chronicles and documents\\nfrom the Mughal court (see also Chapter 9) .\\nOne of the most important chronicles was the\\nAin-i Akbari  (in short the Ain, see also Section 8)\\nauthored by Akbar’s court historian Abu’l Fazl. This\\ntext meticulously recorded the arrangements made\\nby the state to ensure cultivation, to enable the\\ncollection of revenue by the agencies of the state\\nand to regulate the relationship between the state\\nand rural magnates, the zamindars.\\nThe central purpose of the Ain was to present a\\nvision of Akbar’s empire where social harmony was\\nprovided by a strong ruling class. Any revolt or assertion\\nof autonomous power against the Mughal state was,\\nin the eyes of the author of the Ain, predestined to fail.\\nIn other words, whatever we learn from the Ain about\\npeasants remains a view from the top.\\nFortunately, however , the account of the Ain can\\nbe supplemented by descriptions contained in sources\\nemanating from regions away from the Mughal\\ncapital. These include detailed revenue records from\\nGujarat, Maharashtra and Rajasthan dating from\\nthe seventeenth and eighteenth centuries. Further ,\\nthe extensive records of the East India Company (see\\nalso Chapter 10) provide us with useful descriptions\\nof agrarian relations in eastern India. All these\\nsources record instances of conflicts between\\npeasants, zamindars and the state. In the process\\nthey give us an insight into peasants’ perception of\\nand their expectations of fairness from the state.\\n1.2 Peasants and their lands\\nThe term which Indo-Persian sources of the Mughal\\nperiod most frequently used to denote a peasant was\\nraiyat (plural, riaya ) or muzarian . In addition, we\\nalso encounter the terms kisan or asami.   Sources of\\nthe seventeenth century refer to two kinds of\\npeasants – khud-kashta  and pahi-kashta . The formerPEASANTS , ZAMINDARS  AND THE STATE\\n2024-25\\n THEMES  IN INDIAN H ISTORY  – P ART II 198\\nwere residents of the village in which they held their\\nlands. The latter were non-resident cultivators who\\nbelonged to some other village, but cultivated lands\\nelsewhere on a contractual basis. People became\\npahi-kashta either out of choice – for example, when\\nterms of revenue in a distant village were more\\nfavourable – or out of compulsion – for example,\\nforced by economic distress after a famine.\\nSeldom did the average peasant of north India\\npossess more than a pair of bullocks and two\\nploughs; most possessed even less. In Gujarat\\npeasants possessing about six acres of land were\\nconsidered to be affluent; in Bengal, on the other\\nhand, five acres was the upper limit of an average\\npeasant far m; 10 acres would make one a rich asami.\\nCultivation was based on the principle of individual\\nownership. Peasant lands were bought and sold in\\nthe same way as the lands of other property owners.\\nThis nineteenth-century description of peasant\\nholdings in the Delhi-Agra region would apply equally\\nto the seventeenth century:\\nThe cultivating peasants ( asamis ), who plough\\nup the fields, mark the limits of each field, for\\nidentification and demarcation, with borders of\\n(raised) earth, brick and thorn so that thousands\\nof such fields may be counted in a village.\\n1.3 Irrigation and technology\\nThe abundance of land, available labour and the\\nmobility of peasants were three factors that\\naccounted for the constant expansion of agriculture.\\nSince the primary purpose of agriculture is to feed\\npeople, basic staples such as rice, wheat or millets\\nwere the most frequently cultivated crops. Areas\\nwhich received 40 inches or more of rainfall a year\\nwere generally rice-producing zones, followed by\\nwheat and millets, corresponding to a descending\\nscale of precipitation.\\nMonsoons remained the backbone of Indian\\nagriculture, as they are even today. But there were\\ncrops which r equir ed additional water . Artificial\\nsystems of irrigation had to be devised for this.Peasants on the move\\nThis was a feature of agrarian\\nsociety which struck a keen\\nobserver lik e Babur , the first\\nMughal emper or, for cefully\\nenough for him to write about it\\nin the Babur Nama , his memoirs :\\nIn Hindustan hamlets and\\nvillages, towns indeed, are\\ndepopulated and set up in\\na moment!

Autumn crops grow by the\\ndownpour of the rains themselves; and strange it is that spring\\ncrops grow even when no rains fall. (However)  to young trees\\nwater is made to flow by means of buckets or wheels …\\nIn Lahore, Dipalpur (both in present-day Pakistan) and those\\nother parts, people water by means of a wheel. They make two\\ncircles of rope long enough to suit the depths of the well, fix\\nstrips of wood between them, and on these fasten pitchers.\\nThe ropes with the wood and attached pitchers are put over\\nthe wheel-well. At one end of the wheel-axle a second wheel is\\nfixed, and close to it another on an upright axle. The last wheel\\nthe bullock turns; its teeth catch in the teeth of the second\\n(wheel), and thus the wheel with the pitchers is turned. A\\ntrough is set where the water empties from the pitchers and\\nfrom this the water is conveyed everywhere.\\nIn Agra, Chandwar , Bayana (all in pr esent-day Uttar P radesh)\\nand those parts again, people water with a bucket …  At the\\nwell-edge they set up a fork of wood, having a roller adjusted\\nbetween the forks, tie a rope to a large bucket, put the rope\\nover a r oller, and tie its other end to the bullock.

One example was the wooden plough, which\\nwas light and easily assembled with an iron tip or\\ncoulter . It ther efore did not make deep furr ows, which\\npreserved the moisture better during the intensely\\nhot months. A drill, pulled by a pair of giant oxen,\\nwas used to plant seeds, but broadcasting of\\nseed was the most prevalent method. Hoeing and\\nweeding were done simultaneously using a narrow\\niron blade with a small wooden handle.\\n1.4 An abundance of crops\\nAgriculture was organised around two major\\nseasonal cycles, the kharif  (autumn) and the rabi\\n(spring). This would mean that most regions,  except\\nthose terrains that were the most arid or\\ninhospitable, produced a minimum of two crops a\\nyear ( do-fasla ), whereas some, where rainfall or\\nirrigation assur ed a continuous supply of water , even\\ngave three crops. This ensured an enormous variety\\nof produce. For instance, we are told in the Ain that\\nthe Mughal provinces of Agra produced 39 varieties\\nof crops and Delhi produced 43 over the two seasons.\\nBengal produced 50 varieties of rice alone.\\nHowever , the focus on the cultivation of basic\\nstaples did not mean that agriculture in medieval\\nIndia was only for subsistence. W e often come acr oss\\nthe term jins-i kamil (literally, perfect crops) in our\\nsources. The Mughal state also encouraged peasants\\nto cultivate such crops as they brought in more\\nrevenue. Crops such as cotton and sugarcane were\\njins-i kamil par excellence. Cotton was grown over a\\ngreat swathe of territory spread over central India\\nand the Deccan plateau, whereas Bengal was famous\\nfor its sugar . Such cash cr ops would also include\\nvarious sorts of oilseeds (for example, mustard) and\\nlentils. This shows how subsistence and commercial\\nproduction were closely intertwined in an average\\npeasant’s holding.\\nDuring the seventeenth century several new crops\\nfrom different parts of the world reached the IndianThe spread of tobacco\\nThis plant, which arrived first\\nin the Deccan, spread to\\nnorthern India in the early years\\nof the seventeenth century .

The Village Community\\nThe above account makes it clear that agricultural\\nproduction involved the intensive participation and\\ninitiative of the peasantry. How did this affect the\\nstructure of agrarian relations in Mughal society?\\nTo find out, let us look at the social groups involved\\nin agricultural expansion, and at their relationships\\nand conflicts.\\nWe have seen that peasants held their lands in\\nindividual ownership. At the same time they belonged\\nto a collective village community as far as many\\naspects of their social existence were concerned.\\nThere were three constituents of this community –\\nthe cultivators, the panchayat, and the village\\nheadman ( muqaddam  or mandal).\\n2.1 Caste and the rural milieu\\nDeep inequities on the basis of caste and other caste-\\nlike distinctions meant that the cultivators were a\\nhighly heterogeneous group. Among those who tilled\\nthe land, there was a sizeable number who worked\\nas menials or agricultural\\nlabourers ( majur ).\\nDespite the abundance of\\ncultivable land, certain caste\\ngroups were assigned menial\\ntasks and thus relegated to\\npoverty. Though there was\\nno census at  that  time, the\\nlittle data that we have\\nsuggest that such groups\\ncomprised a large section of\\nthe village population, had\\nthe least resources and were\\nconstrained by their position\\nin the caste hierarchy, much\\nlike the Dalits of modern\\nIndia. Such distinctions had\\nbegun permeating into other/circleright Discuss...\\nIdentify the technologies\\nand agricultural practices\\ndescribed in this section that\\nappear similar to or different\\nfrom those described in\\nChapter 2.\\nPEASANTS, Z AMINDARS  AND THE STATE\\nFig. 8.3\\nAn early nineteenth-century\\npainting depicting a village in\\nthe Punjab\\n/circleright Describe what women and\\nmen are shown doing in the\\nillustration as well as the\\narchitecture of the village.\\n2024-25\\n THEMES  IN INDIAN H ISTORY  – P ART II 202\\ncommunities too. In Muslim communities menials like\\nthe halalkhoran  (scavengers) were housed outside the\\nboundaries of the village; similarly the mallahzadas\\n(literally, sons of boatmen) in Bihar were comparable\\nto slaves.\\nThere was a direct correlation between caste,\\npoverty and social status at the lower strata of\\nsociety. Such correlations were not so marked at\\nintermediate levels. In a manual from seventeenth-\\ncentury Marwar , Rajputs ar e mentioned as peasants,\\nsharing the same space with Jats, who were accorded\\na lower status in the caste hierarchy. The Gauravas,\\nwho cultivated land ar ound V rindavan (Uttar\\nPradesh), sought Rajput status in the seventeenth\\ncentury. Castes such as the Ahirs, Gujars and Malis\\nrose in the hierarchy because of the profitability of\\ncattle rearing and horticulture. In the eastern\\nregions, intermediate pastoral and fishing castes\\nlike the Sadgops  and Kaivartas acquired the status\\nof peasants.\\n2.2 Panchayats and headmen\\nThe village panchayat was  an assembly of elders,\\nusually important people of the village with hereditary\\nrights over their property. In mixed-caste villages,\\nthe panchayat was usually a heterogeneous body. An\\noligarchy, the panchayat represented various castes\\nand communities in the village, though the village\\nmenial-cum-agricultural worker was unlikely to be\\nrepresented there. The decisions made by these\\npanchayats were binding on the members.\\nThe panchayat was headed by a headman known\\nas muqaddam or mandal. Some sources suggest that\\nthe headman was chosen through the consensus of\\nthe village elders, and that this choice had to be\\nratified by the zamindar . Headmen held of fice as long\\nas they enjoyed the confidence of the village elders,\\nfailing which they could be dismissed by them. The\\nchief function of the headman was to supervise the\\npreparation of village accounts, assisted by the\\naccountant or patwari  of the panchayat.\\nThe panchayat  derived its funds from\\ncontributions made by individuals to a common\\nfinancial pool. These funds were used for defraying\\nthe costs of entertaining revenue officials who\\nvisited the village from time to time. Expenses for\\ncommunity welfare activities such as tiding overCorrupt mandals\\nThe mandals often misused their\\npositions. They were principally\\naccused of defrauding village\\naccounts in connivance with the\\npatwari , and for underassessing\\nthe revenue they owed from\\ntheir own lands in order to pass\\nthe additional burden on to the\\nsmaller cultivator .\\n2024-25\\n203\\nFig. 8.4\\nAn early nineteenth-century\\npainting depicting a meeting of\\nvillage elders and tax collectorsnatural calamities (like\\nfloods), were also met from\\nthese funds. Often these\\nfunds were also deployed in\\nconstruction of a bund or\\ndigging a canal  which\\npeasants usually could not\\nafford to do on their own.\\nOne important function of\\nthe panchayat was to ensure\\nthat caste boundaries among\\nthe various communities\\ninhabiting the village were\\nupheld. In eastern India all\\nmarriages were held in the\\npresence of the mandal . In other words one of the\\nduties of the village headman was to oversee the\\nconduct of the members of the village community\\n“chiefly to prevent any offence against their caste”.\\nPanchayats also had the authority to levy fines\\nand inflict more serious forms of punishment like\\nexpulsion from the community. The latter was a\\ndrastic step and was in most cases meted out for a\\nlimited period. It meant that a person forced to leave\\nthe village became an outcaste and lost his right\\nto practise his profession. Such a measure was\\nintended as a deterrent to violation of caste norms.\\nIn addition to the village panchayat each caste\\nor jati in the village had its own jati panchayat.\\nThese panchayats wielded considerable power\\nin rural society. In Rajasthan jati  panchayats\\narbitrated civil disputes between members of\\ndifferent castes. They mediated in contested claims\\non land, decided whether marriages were performed\\naccording to the norms laid down by a particular\\ncaste group, determined who had ritual precedence\\nin village functions, and so on. In most cases,\\nexcept in matters of criminal justice, the state\\nrespected the decisions of jati panchayats.\\nArchival records from western India – notably\\nRajasthan and Maharashtra – contain petitions\\npresented to the panchayat complaining about\\nextortionate taxation or the demand for unpaid\\nlabour ( begar ) imposed by the “superior” castes or\\nofficials of the state. These petitions were usually\\nmade by villagers, from the lowest rungs of rural\\nsociety. Often petitions were made collectively as\\nPEASANTS, Z AMINDARS  AND THE STATE\\n/circleright How has the artist\\ndifferentiated between the\\nvillage elders and the\\ntax collectors?\\n2024-25\\n THEMES  IN INDIAN H ISTORY  – P ART II 204\\nwell, by a caste group or a community protesting\\nagainst what they considered were morally\\nillegitimate demands on the part of elite groups.\\nThese included excessive tax demands which,\\nespecially in times of drought or other disasters,\\nendangered the peasants’ subsistence. In the eyes\\nof the petitioners the right to the basic minimum for\\nsurvival was sanctioned by custom. They regarded\\nthe village panchayat as the court of appeal that\\nwould ensure that the state carried out its moral\\nobligations and guaranteed justice.\\nThe decision of the panchayat in\\nconflicts between “lower -caste”\\npeasants and state officials or the\\nlocal zamindar could vary from\\ncase to case. In cases of excessive\\nrevenue demands, the panchayat\\noften suggested compromise. In\\ncases where reconciliation failed,\\npeasants took recourse to more\\ndrastic forms of resistance, such as\\ndeserting the village. The relatively\\neasy availability of uncultivated land\\nand the competition over labour\\nresources made this an effective\\nweapon in the hands of cultivators.\\n2.3 Village artisans\\nAnother interesting aspect of\\nthe village was the elaborate\\nrelationship of exchange between\\ndifferent producers. Marathi\\ndocuments and village surveys\\nmade in the early years of British\\nrule have revealed the existence of\\nsubstantial numbers of artisans,\\nsometimes as high as 25 per cent of\\nthe total households in the villages.\\nAt times, however, the distinction\\nbetween artisans and peasants in\\nvillage society was a fluid one, as\\nmany groups performed the tasks\\nof both. Cultivators and their\\nfamilies would also participate in\\ncraft production – such as dyeing,\\ntextile printing, baking and firing\\nof pottery, making and repairing\\nFig. 8.5\\nA seventeenth-century painting\\ndepicting textile production\\n/circleright Describe the activities that\\nare shown in the illustration.\\n2024-25\\n205\\nagricultural implements. Phases in the agricultural\\ncalendar when there was a relative lull in activity,\\nas between sowing and weeding or between weeding\\nand harvesting, were a time when cultivators could\\nengage in artisanal production.\\nVillage artisans – potters, blacksmiths, carpenters,\\nbarbers, even goldsmiths – provided specialised\\nservices in return for which they were compensated\\nby villagers by a variety of means. The most common\\nway of doing so was by giving them a share of the\\nharvest, or an allotment of land, perhaps cultivable\\nwastes, which was likely to be decided by the\\npanchayat . In Maharashtra such lands became the\\nartisans’ miras  or watan –  their hereditary holding.\\nAnother variant of this was a system where\\nartisans and individual peasant households entered\\ninto a mutually negotiated system of remuneration,\\nmost of the time goods for services. For example,\\neighteenth-century records tell us of zamindars  in\\nBengal who remunerated blacksmiths, carpenters,\\neven goldsmiths for their work by paying them “a\\nsmall daily allowance and diet money”. This later\\ncame to be described as the jajmani system,\\nthough the term was not in vogue in the sixteenth\\nand seventeenth centuries. Such evidence is\\ninteresting because it indicates the intricate ways\\nin which exchange networks operated at the\\nmicro -level of the village. Cash remuneration was\\nnot entir ely unknown  either .\\n2.4  A “little republic”?\\nHow does one understand the significance of the\\nvillage community? Some British officials in the\\nnineteenth century saw the village as a “little\\nrepublic” made up of fraternal partners sharing\\nresour ces and labour in a collective. However , this\\nwas not a sign of rural egalitarianism. There was\\nindividual ownership of assets and deep inequities\\nbased on caste and gender distinctions. A group\\nof powerful individuals decided the affairs of the\\nvillage, exploited the weaker sections and had the\\nauthority to dispense justice.\\nMore importantly, a cash nexus had already\\ndeveloped through trade between villages and towns.\\nIn the Mughal heartland too, revenue was assessed\\nand collected in cash. Artisans producing for the\\nexport market (for example, weavers) received theirPEASANTS, Z AMINDARS  AND THE STATE\\n2024-25\\n THEMES  IN INDIAN H ISTORY  – P ART II 206\\nadvances or wages in cash, as did producers of\\ncommercial products like cotton, silk or indigo.\\n/circleright Discuss...\\nIn what ways do you think the panchayats\\ndescribed in this section were similar to or\\ndifferent from present-day gram  panchayats ?\\n3. W omen in A grarian Socie ty\\nAs you may have observed in many different societies,\\nthe production process often involves men and\\nwomen performing certain specified roles. In the\\ncontexts that we are exploring, women and men had\\nto work shoulder to shoulder in the fields. Men\\ntilled and ploughed, while women sowed, weeded,\\nthreshed and winnowed the harvest. With the growth\\nof nucleated villages and expansion in individuated\\npeasant farming, which characterised medieval\\nIndian agriculture, the basis of production was the\\nlabour and resources of the entire household.\\nNaturally, a gendered segregation between the home\\n(for women) and the world (for men) was not possible\\nin this context. Nonetheless biases related to women’s\\nbiological functions did continue. Menstruating\\nwomen, for instance, were not allowed to touch the\\nplough or the potter’s wheel in western India, or\\nenter the groves where betel-leaves ( paan ) were\\ngrown in Bengal.\\nArtisanal tasks such as spinning yarn, sifting and\\nkneading clay for pottery, and embroidery were among\\nthe many aspects of production dependent on female\\nlabour . The mor e commer cialised the pr oduct, the\\ngreater the demand on women’s labour to produce it.\\nIn fact, peasant and artisan women worked not only\\nin the fields, but even went to the houses of their\\nemployers or to the markets if necessary.\\nWomen wer e consider ed an important r esour ce in\\nagrarian society also because they were child bearers\\nin a society dependent on labour . At the same time,\\nhigh mortality rates among women – owing to\\nmalnutrition, frequent pregnancies, death during\\nchildbirth – often meant a shortage of wives. This\\nled to the emergence of social customs in peasant\\nand artisan communities that were distinct fromMoney in the village\\nThe seventeenth-century  F rench\\ntraveller Jean -Baptiste T avernier\\nfound it remarkable that in\\n“India a village must be very small\\nindeed if it has not a money-\\nchanger called a Shroff .

Marriages in\\nmany rural communities required the payment of\\nbride-price rather than dowry to the bride’s family.\\nRemarriage was considered legitimate both among\\ndivorced and widowed women.\\nThe importance attached to women as a\\nreproductive force also meant that the fear of losing\\ncontrol over them was great. According to established\\nsocial norms, the household was headed by a male.\\nThus women were kept under strict control by the\\nmale members of the family and the community.\\nThey could inflict draconian punishments if they\\nsuspected infidelity on the part of women.\\nDocuments fr om W estern India – Rajasthan, Gujarat\\nand Maharashtra – record petitions sent by women to\\nthe village panchayat, seeking redress and justice.\\nWives protested against the infidelity of their\\nhusbands or the neglect of the wife and children by\\nthe male head of the household, the grihasthi . While\\nmale infidelity was not always punished, the  state\\nand “superior” caste groups did intervene when it came\\nto ensuring that the family was adequately provided\\nfor. In most cases when women petitioned to the\\npanchayat, their names were excluded from the\\nrecord: the petitioner was r eferred to as the mother ,\\nsister or wife of the male head of the household.\\nAmongst the landed gentry, women had the right\\nto inherit property. Instances from the Punjab show\\nthat women, including widows, actively participated\\nin the rural land market as sellers of property inherited\\nby them. Hindu and Muslim women inherited\\nzamindaris which they were free to sell or mortgage.\\nWomen zamindars  were known in eighteenth-century\\nBengal. In fact, one of the biggest and most famous of\\nthe eighteenth-century zamindaris, that of Rajshahi,\\nhad a woman at the helm.\\nFig. 8.8 b\\nWomen carrying loads\\nMigrant women from  neighbouring\\nvillages often worked at such\\nconstruction sites.\\nPEASANTS, Z AMINDARS  AND THE STATE\\nFig. 8.8 a\\nThe construction of Fatehpur Sikri  –\\nwomen crushing stones\\n/circleright Discuss...\\nAre there any differences in the access men and\\nwomen have to agricultural land in your state?\\n2024-25\\n THEMES  IN INDIAN H ISTORY  – P ART II 208\\n4. F orests and T ribes\\n4.1 Beyond settled villages\\nThere was more to rural India than sedentary\\nagriculture. Apart from the intensively cultivated\\nprovinces in northern and north-western India,\\nhuge swathes of forests – dense forest ( jangal ) or\\nscrubland (kharbandi ) – existed all over eastern\\nIndia, central India, northern India (including the\\nTerai on the Indo-Nepal border), Jharkhand, and in\\npeninsular India down the W ester n Ghats and the\\nDeccan plateau. Though it is nearly impossible to\\nset an all-India average of the forest cover for this\\nperiod, informed conjectures based on contemporary\\nsources suggest an average of 40 per cent.\\nForest dwellers were termed jangli\\n in\\ncontemporary texts. Being jangli, however , did\\nnot mean an  absence of “civilisation”,\\nas popular usage of the term today\\nseems to connote. Rather , the ter m\\ndescribed those whose livelihood\\ncame from the gathering of forest\\nproduce, hunting and shifting\\nagriculture. These activities were\\nlargely season specific. Among the\\nBhils, for example, spring was reserved\\nfor collecting forest produce, summer\\nfor fishing, the monsoon months\\nfor cultivation, and autumn and\\nwinter for hunting. Such a sequence\\npresumed and perpetuated mobility,\\nwhich was a distinctive feature of\\ntribes inhabiting these forests.\\nFor the state, the forest was a\\nsubversive place  – a place of refuge\\n(mawas ) for troublemakers.

The Zamindars\\nOur story of agrarian relations in Mughal India will\\nnot be complete without referring to a class of\\npeople in the countryside that lived off agriculture\\nbut did not participate directly in the processes of\\nagricultural production. These were the zamindars\\nwho were landed proprietors who also enjoyed certain\\nsocial and economic privileges by virtue of their\\nsuperior status in rural society. Caste was one factor\\nthat accounted for the elevated status of zamindars;\\nanother factor was that they performed certain\\nservices ( khidmat ) for the state.\\nThe zamindars held extensive personal lands\\ntermed milkiyat,  meaning property. Milkiyat lands\\nwere cultivated for the private use of zamindars,\\noften with the help of hir ed or servile labour . The\\nzamindars could sell, bequeath or mortgage these\\nlands at will.\\nZamindars also derived their power from the fact\\nthat they could often collect revenue on behalf of\\nthe state, a service for which they were compensated\\nfinancially. Control over military resources was\\nanother sour ce of power . Most zamindars had\\nfortresses ( qilachas ) as well as an armed contingent\\ncomprising units of cavalry, artillery and infantry.\\nThus if we visualise social relations in the\\nMughal countryside as a pyramid, zamindars clearly\\nconstituted its very narrow apex.

It also reflects a fairly large\\nrepresentation from the so-called intermediate castes,\\nas we saw earlier , as well as a liberal sprinkling of\\nMuslim zamindaris.\\nContemporary documents give an impression that\\nconquest may have been the source of the origin of\\nsome zamindaris . The dispossession of weaker people\\nby a powerful military chieftain was quite often a\\nway of expanding a zamindari. It is, however , unlikely\\nthat the state would have allowed such a show of\\naggression by a zamindar unless he had been\\nconfirmed by an imperial order ( sanad ).\\nMore important were the slow processes of\\nzamindari consolidation, which are also documented\\nin sources. These involved colonisation of new lands,\\nby transfer of rights, by order of the state and by\\npurchase. These were the processes which perhaps\\npermitted people belonging to the relatively “lower”\\ncastes to enter the rank of zamindars  as zamindaris\\nwere bought and sold quite briskly in this period.\\nA combination of factors also allowed the\\nconsolidation of clan- or lineage-based zamindaris.\\nFor example, the Rajputs and Jats adopted these\\nstrategies to consolidate their control over vast\\nswathes of territory in northern India. Likewise,\\npeasant-pastoralists (like the Sadgops) carved out\\npowerful zamindaris in areas of central and south-\\nwestern Bengal.\\nZamindars spearheaded the colonisation of\\nagricultural land, and helped in settling cultivators\\nby providing them with the means of cultivation,\\nincluding cash loans. The buying and selling of\\nzamindaris accelerated the process of monetisation\\nin the countryside.  In addition, zamindars sold the\\nproduce from their milkiyat  lands. There is evidence\\nto show that zamindars often established markets ( haats )\\nto which peasants also came to sell their produce.\\nAlthough there can be little doubt that zamindars\\nwere an exploitative class, their relationship with the\\npeasantry had an element of reciprocity, paternalism\\nand patronage. Two aspects reinforce this view. First,\\nthe bhakti saints, who eloquently condemned\\ncaste-based and other forms of oppression (see also\\nChapter 6), did not portray the zamindars (or ,\\ninterestingly, the moneylender) as exploiters or\\noppressors of the peasantry. Usually it was theA parallel army!\\nAccording to the Ain, the\\ncombined military strength of\\nthe zamindars in Mughal India\\nwas 384,558 cavalry , 4,277,057\\ninfantry , 1,863 elephants, 4,260\\ncannons, and 4,500 boats.\\n2024-25\\n213\\nrevenue official of the state who was the object of their\\nire. Second, in a large number of agrarian uprisings\\nwhich erupted in north India in the seventeenth\\ncentury, zamindars often received the support of the\\npeasantry in their struggle against the state.\\n6. Land Revenue System\\nRevenue from the land was the economic mainstay\\nof the Mughal Empire. It was therefore vital for the\\nstate to create an administrative apparatus to ensure\\ncontrol over agricultural production, and to fix and\\ncollect revenue from across the length and breadth\\nof the rapidly expanding empire. This apparatus\\nincluded the office ( daftar ) of the diwan who was\\nresponsible for supervising the fiscal system of the\\nempire. Thus revenue officials and record keepers\\npenetrated the agricultural domain and became a\\ndecisive agent in shaping agrarian relations.\\nThe Mughal state tried to first acquire specific\\ninformation about the extent of the agricultural\\nlands in the empire and what these lands produced\\nbefore fixing the burden of taxes on people. The\\nland  revenue arrangements consisted of two\\nstages  – first, assessment and then actual collection.\\nThe jama  was the amount assessed, as opposed to\\nhasil, the amount collected. In his list of duties of\\nthe amil-guzar  or r evenue collector , Akbar decr eed\\nthat while he should strive to make cultivators pay\\nin cash, the option of payment in kind was also to\\nbe kept open. While fixing revenue, the attempt of\\nthe state was to maximise its claims. The scope of\\nactually r ealising these claims was, however ,\\nsometimes thwarted by local conditions.\\nBoth cultivated and cultivable lands were measured\\nin each province. The Ain compiled the aggregates of\\nsuch lands during Akbar’s rule. Efforts to measure\\nlands continued under subsequent emperors. For\\ninstance, in 1665, Aurangzeb expressly instructed his\\nrevenue officials to prepare annual records of the\\nnumber of cultivators in each village (Sour ce 7). Y et\\nnot all areas were measured successfully. As we have\\nseen, forests covered huge areas of the subcontinent\\nand thus remained unmeasured./circleright Discuss...\\nThe zamindari  system was\\nabolished in India after\\nIndependence.

Of the first two\\nkinds of land, there are three classes, good, middling,\\nand bad.  They add together the produce of each sort,\\nand the third of this represents the medium produce,\\none-third part of which is exacted as the Royal dues.\\nThe mansabdari system\\nThe Mughal administrative\\nsystem had at its apex a military-\\ncum-bureaucratic apparatus\\n(mansabdari ) which was\\nresponsible for looking after the\\ncivil and military affairs of the\\nstate. Some  mansabdars  were\\npaid in cash ( naqdi),  while the\\nmajority of them were paid\\nthrough assignments of revenue\\n(jagirs ) in different regions of the\\nempire.

It was completed in 1598, the forty-second\\nregnal year of the emper or, after having gone thr ough\\nfive revisions. The Ain was part of a larger project\\nof history writing commissioned by Akbar . This\\nhistory, known as the Akbar Nama,  comprised three\\nbooks.

The Ain-i Akbari , the third book, was organised\\nas a compendium of imperial regulations and a\\ngazetteer of the empire.\\nThe Ain gives detailed accounts of the organisation\\nof the court, administration and  army, the sources\\nof revenue and the physical  layout of the provinces\\nof Akbar’s empire and the literary, cultural and\\nreligious traditions of the people.

The Ain is therefore a mine of\\ninformation for us about the Mughal Empire during\\nAkbar’s r eign. It is important, however , to keep in\\nmind that this is a view of the regions from the\\ncentre, a view of society from its apex.\\nThe Ain is made up of five books ( daftars ), of which\\nthe first three books describe the administration.\\nThe first book, called manzil-abadi , concerns the\\nimperial household and its maintenance. The second\\nbook, sipah-abadi , covers the military and civil\\nadministration and the establishment of servants.\\nThis book includes notices and short biographical\\nsketches of imperial officials ( mansabdars ), learned\\nmen, poets and artists.\\nThe third book, mulk-abadi , is the one which deals\\nwith the fiscal side of the empire and provides rich\\nquantitative information on revenue rates, followed\\nby the “Account of the Twelve Provinces”. This section\\nhas detailed statistical information, which includes\\nthe geographic, topographic and economic profile of\\nall subas and their administrative and fiscal\\ndivisions ( sarkars , parganas and mahals ), total\\nmeasured area, and assessed revenue (jama).\\nAfter setting out details at the suba level, the Ain\\ngoes on to give a detailed picture of the sarkars  below\\nthe suba.

The mulk-abadi gives a\\nfascinating, detailed and highly complex view of\\nagrarian society in northern India. The fourth and\\nfifth books ( daftars ) deal with the religious, literary\\nand cultural traditions of the people of India and also\\ncontain a collection of Akbar’s “auspicious sayings”.Fig. 8.14\\nAbu’l Fazl presenting the\\nmanuscript of the completed\\nAkbar Nama to his patron\\n2024-25\\n219\\nSource 9\\n“Moistening the rose garden of fortune”\\nIn this e xtract Abu’l F azl gives a vivid account of how and fr om whom he\\ncollected his information:\\n... to Abu’l F azl, son of Mubarak … this sublime mandate was given.\\n“Write with the pen of sincerity the account of the glorious events\\nand of our dominion -conquering victories … Assur edly, I spent much\\nlabour and research in collecting the records and narratives of His\\nMajesty’s actions and I was a long time interrogating the servants of\\nthe State and the old members of the illustrious family . I examined\\nboth prudent, truth-speaking old men and active-minded, right-\\nactioned young ones and reduced their statements to writing. The\\nRoyal commands were issued to the provinces, that those who from\\nold service remembered, with certainty or with adminicle of doubt,\\nthe events of the past, should copy out the notes and memoranda\\nand transit them to the court. (Then) a second command shone forth\\nfrom the holy Presence-chamber; to wit – that the materials which\\nhad been collected should be ... recited in the royal hearing, and\\nwhatever might have to be written down afterwards, should be\\nintroduced into the noble volume as a supplement, and that such\\ndetails as on account of the minuteness of the inquiries and the\\nminutae  of affairs, (which) could not then be brought to an end,\\nshould be inserted afterwards at my leisure.\\nBeing relieved by this royal order – the interpreter of the Divine\\nordinance – from the secret anxiety of my heart, I proceeded to\\nreduce into writing the rough draughts (drafts)which were void of\\nthe grace of arrangement and style.

That the manuscript\\nwas revised five times by the author would suggest\\na high degree of caution on the part of Abu’l Fazl\\nand a search for authenticity.

Numerous\\nerrors in totalling have been detected. These are\\nascribed to simple slips of arithmetic or of\\ntranscription by Abu’l Fazl’s assistants. These are\\ngenerally minor and do not detract from the overall\\nquantitative veracity of the manuals.\\nAnother limitation of the Ain is the somewhat\\nskewed nature of the quantitative data.  Data were\\nnot collected uniformly from all provinces.

The consumer has to decide how to spend her income\\non different goods1. Economists call this the problem of choice.\\nMost naturally, any consumer will want to get a combination of\\ngoods that gives her maximum satisfaction. What will be this ‘best’\\ncombination? This depends on the likes of the consumer and what\\nthe consumer can afford to buy. The ‘likes’ of the consumer are\\nalso called ‘preferences’. And what the consumer can afford to buy,\\ndepends on prices of the goods and the income of the consumer .\\nThis chapter presents two different approaches that explain\\nconsumer behaviour (i) Cardinal Utility Analysis and (ii) Ordinal\\nUtility Analysis.\\nPreliminary Notations and Assumptions\\nA consumer , in general, consumes many goods; but for simplicity,\\nwe shall consider the consumer’s choice problem in a situation\\nwhere there are only two goods2: bananas and mangoes. Any\\ncombination of the amount of the two goods will be called a\\nconsumption bundle or , in short, a bundle. In general, we shall\\nuse the variable x1 to denote the quantity of bananas and x2 to\\ndenote the quantity of mangoes. x1 and x2 can be positive or zero.\\n(x1, x2) would mean the bundle consisting of x1 quantity of bananas\\nand x2 quantity of mangoes. For particular values of x1 and x2, (x1,\\nx2), would give us a particular bundle. For example, the bundle\\n(5,10) consists of 5 bananas and 10 mangoes; the bundle (10, 5)\\nconsists of 10 bananas and 5 mangoes.\\n2.1 U TILITY\\nA consumer usually decides his demand for a commodity on the\\nbasis of utility (or satisfaction) that he derives from it. What is\\nutility? Utility of a commodity is its want-satisfying capacity. The\\nmore the need of a commodity or the stronger the desire to have it,\\nthe greater is the utility derived from the commodity.\\nUtility is subjective. Different individuals can get different levels\\nof utility from the same commodity. For example, some one who\\n1We shall use the ter m goods to mean goods as well as services.\\n2The assumption that there are only two goods simplifies the analysis considerably and allows us\\nto understand some important concepts by using simple diagrams.\\nReprint 2024-25\\nlikes chocolates will get much higher utility from a chocolate than some one\\nwho is not so fond of chocolates, Also, utility that one individual gets from the\\ncommodity can change with change in place and time. For example, utility from\\nthe use of a room heater will depend upon whether the individual is in Ladakh\\nor Chennai (place) or whether it is summer or winter (time).\\n2.1.1 Cardinal Utility Analysis\\nCardinal utility analysis assumes that level of utility can be expressed in\\nnumbers. For example, we can measure the utility derived from a shirt and say,\\nthis shirt gives me 50 units of utility. Before discussing further , it will be useful\\nto have a look at two important measures of utility.\\nMeasures of Utility\\nTotal Utility : Total utility of a fixed quantity of a commodity (TU) is the total\\nsatisfaction derived from consuming the given amount of some commodity x.\\nMore of commodity x provides mor e satisfaction to the consumer . TU depends\\non the quantity of the commodity consumed. Therefore, TUn refers to total utility\\nderived from consuming n units of a commodity x.\\nMarginal Utility : Marginal utility (MU) is the change in total utility due to\\nconsumption of one additional unit of a commodity. For example, suppose 4\\nbananas give us 28 units of total utility and 5 bananas give us 30 units of total\\nutility. Clearly, consumption of the 5th banana has caused total utility to increase\\nby 2 units (30 units minus 28 units). Therefore,  marginal utility of the 5th banana\\nis 2 units.\\nMU5 =  TU5 – TU4 = 30 – 28 = 2\\nIn general, MUn = TUn – TUn-1, where subscript n refers to the nth unit of the\\ncommodity\\nTotal utility and marginal utility can also be related in the following way.\\nTUn = MU1 + MU2 + … + MUn-1 + MUn\\nThis simply means that TU derived from consuming n units of bananas is\\nthe sum total of marginal utility of first banana (MU1), marginal utility of second\\nbanana (MU2), and so on, till the marginal utility of the nth unit.\\nTable No. 2.1 and Figure 2.1 show an imaginary example of the values of\\nmarginal and total utility derived from consumption of various amounts of a\\ncommodity. Usually, it is seen that the marginal utility diminishes with increase\\nin consumption of the commodity. This happens because having obtained some\\namount of the commodity, the desire of the consumer to have still more of it\\nbecomes weaker . The same is also shown in the table and graph.\\nTable 2.1: V alues of mar ginal and total utility derived from consumption\\nof various amounts of a commodity\\n9Theory of Consumer\\nBehaviour\\n         Units     Total Utility     Marginal Utility\\n1 12 12\\n2 18   6\\n3 22   4\\n4 24   2\\n5 24   0\\n6 22  -2\\nReprint 2024-25\\n10Introductory\\nMicroeconomicsNotice that MU3 is less than\\nMU2. You may also notice that\\ntotal utility increases but at a\\ndiminishing rate: The rate of\\nchange in total utility due to\\nchange in quantity of commodity\\nconsumed is a measure of\\nmarginal utility. This marginal\\nutility diminishes with increase\\nin consumption of the\\ncommodity from 12 to 6, 6 to 4\\nand so on. This follows from the\\nlaw of diminishing marginal\\nutility. Law of Diminishing\\nMarginal Utility  states that\\nmarginal utility from consuming each additional unit of a commodity declines\\nas its consumption increases, while keeping consumption of other commodities\\nconstant.\\nMU becomes zero at a level when TU remains constant. In the example, TU\\ndoes not change at 5th unit of consumption and ther efore MU5= 0. Ther eafter ,\\nTU starts falling and MU becomes negative.\\nDerivation of Demand Curve in the Case of a Single Commodity (Law of\\nDiminishing Marginal Utility)\\nCardinal utility analysis can be used to derive demand curve for a commodity.\\nWhat is demand and what is demand curve? The quantity of a commodity that\\na consumer is willing to buy and is able to afford, given prices of goods and\\nincome of the consumer , is called demand for that commodity. Demand for a\\ncommodity x, apart from the price of x itself, depends on factors such as prices\\nof other commodities (see substitutes and complements 2.4.4), income of the\\nconsumer and tastes and preferences of the consumers. Demand curve is a\\ngraphic presentation of various quantities of a commodity that a consumer is\\nwilling to buy at different prices of the same commodity, while holding constant\\nprices of other related commodities\\nand income of the consumer .\\nFigure 2.2 presents hypothetical\\ndemand curve of an individual for\\ncommodity x at its different prices.\\nQuantity is measured along the\\nhorizontal axis and price is measured\\nalong the vertical axis.\\nThe downward sloping demand\\ncurve shows that at lower prices, the\\nindividual is willing to buy more of\\ncommodity x; at higher prices, she is\\nwilling to buy less of commodity x.\\nTherefore, there is a negative\\nrelationship between price of a\\ncommodity and quantity demanded which is referred to as the Law of Demand.\\nAn explaination for a downward sloping demand curve rests on the notion\\nof diminishing marginal utility. The law of diminishing marginal utility states\\nthat each successive unit of a commodity provides lower marginal utility.\\nDemand curve of an individual for\\ncommodity xThe values of marginal and total utility derived\\nfrom consumption of various amounts of a\\ncommodity.  The marginal utility diminishes with\\nincrease in consumption of the commodity.\\nReprint 2024-25\\n11Theory of Consumer\\nBehaviourTherefore the individual will not be willing to pay as much for each additional\\nunit and this results in a downward sloping demand curve. At a price of Rs. 40\\nper unit x, individual’s demand for x was 5 units. The 6th unit of commodity x\\nwill be worth less than the 5th unit. The individual will be willing to buy the 6th\\nunit only when the price drops below Rs. 40 per unit. Hence, the law of\\ndiminishing marginal utility explains why demand curves have a negative slope.\\n2.1.2 Ordinal Utility Analysis\\nCardinal utility analysis is simple to understand, but suffers from a major\\ndrawback in the form of quantification of utility in numbers. In real life, we\\nnever express utility in the form of numbers. At the most, we can rank various\\nalternative combinations in terms of having more or less utility. In other words,\\nthe consumer does not measure utility in numbers, though she often ranks\\nvarious consumption bundles. This forms the starting point of this topic – Ordinal\\nUtility Analysis.\\nA consumer’s preferences over the set of available bundles can often be\\nrepresented diagrammatically. W e\\nhave already seen that the bundles\\navailable to the consumer can be\\nplotted as points in a two-\\ndimensional diagram. The points\\nrepresenting bundles which give the\\nconsumer equal utility can generally\\nbe joined to obtain a curve like the\\none in Figure 2.3. The consumer is\\nsaid to be indifferent on the different\\nbundles because each point of the\\nbundles give the consumer equal\\nutility.  Such a curve joining all points\\nrepresenting bundles among which\\nthe consumer is indifferent is called\\nan indifference curve . All the points\\nsuch as A, B, C and D lying on an\\nindifference curve provide the consumer with the same level of satisfaction.\\nIt is clear that when a consumer gets one more banana, he has to forego\\nsome mangoes, so that her total utility level remains the same and she remains\\non the same indifference curve. Therefore, indifference curve slopes downward.\\nThe amount of mangoes that the consumer has to forego, in order to get an\\nadditional banana, her total utility level being the same, is called marginal rate\\nof substitution (MRS) . In other words, MRS is simply the rate at which the\\nconsumer will substitute bananas for mangoes, so that her total utility remains\\nconstant. So, / MRS Y X =| ∆ ∆ |3.\\nOne can notice that, in the table 2.2, as we increase the quantity of bananas,\\nthe quantity of mangoes sacrificed for each additional banana declines. In other\\nwords, MRS diminishes with increase in the number of bananas. As the number\\n3 / / ( / ) 0Y X Y X if Y X| ∆ ∆ |= ∆ ∆ ∆ ∆ ≥\\n            / ( / ) 0Y X if Y X = −∆ ∆ ∆ ∆ <\\n/ MRS Y X =| ∆ ∆ | means that MRS equals only the magnitude of the expression /Y X∆ ∆ . If\\n/ 3 /1Y X∆ ∆ = −  it means MRS=3.Indifference curve. An indifference curve joins\\nall points representing bundles which are\\nconsider ed indif ferent by the consumer .\\nA\\nReprint 2024-25\\n12Introductory\\nMicroeconomicsof bananas with the consumer increases, the MU derived from each additional\\nbanana falls. Similarly, with the fall in quantity of mangoes, the marginal utility\\nderived from mangoes increases. So, with increase in the number of bananas,\\nthe consumer will feel the inclination to sacrifice small and smaller amounts of\\nmangoes. This tendency for the MRS to fall with increase in quantity of bananas\\nis known as Law of Diminishing Marginal Rate of Substitution . This can be\\nseen from figure 2.3 also. Going from point A to point B, the consumer sacrifices\\n3 mangoes for 1 banana, going from point B to point C, the consumer sacrifices\\n2 mangoes for 1 banana, and going from point C to point D, the consumer\\nsacrifices just 1 mango for 1 banana. Thus, it is clear that the consumer sacrifices\\nsmaller and smaller quantities of mangoes for each additional banana.\\nShape of an Indifference Curve\\nIt may be mentioned that the law of Diminishing Marginal Rate of Substitution\\ncauses an indifference curve to be convex to the origin. This is the most common\\nshape of an indifference curve. But in case of goods being perfect substitutes4,\\nthe marginal rate of substitution does not diminish. It remains the same. Let’s\\ntake an example.\\nHere, the consumer is indifferent for all these combinations as long as the total\\nof five rupee coins and five rupee notes r emains the same. For the consumer , it\\nhardly matters whether she gets a five rupee coin or a five rupee note. So,\\nirrespective of how many five rupee notes she has, the consumer will sacrifice\\nonly one five rupee coin for a five rupee note. So these two commodities are\\nperfect substitutes for the consumer and indifference curve depicting these will\\nbe a straight line.\\nIn the figure.2.4, it can be seen that consumer sacrifices the same number of\\nfive-rupee coins each time he has an additional five-rupee note.Table 2.2:  Representation of Law of Diminishing Marginal Rate of Substitution\\n    Combinat ion    Quant ity of bananas (Qx)  Quant ity of Mango es (Qy)     MR S\\n             A                                    1                                              15                              -\\n             B                                    2                                              12                           3:1\\n             C                                    3                                               10                          2:1\\n             D                                   4                                                 9                           1:1\\nTable 2.3: Representation of Law of Diminishing Marginal Rate of Substitution\\n    Combinat ion             Quant ity of fi ve                      Quant ity of fi ve               MR S\\n                                  R upees not es (Qx)                 R upees coins  (Qy)\\n             A                                    1                                               8                                 -\\n             B                                    2                                               7                               1:1\\n             C                                    3                                               6                                1:1\\n             D                                   4                                                5                               1:1\\n4 Perfect Substitutes ar e the goods which can be used in place of each other , and pr ovide exactly\\nthe same level of utility to the consumer .\\nReprint 2024-25\\n13Theory of Consumer\\nBehaviourIndifference Map .

Thus, as long as the\\nconsumer is on the same indifference\\ncurve, an increase in bananas must be\\ncompensated by a fall in quantity of\\nmangoes.\\nMonotonic Preferences\\nConsumer’s preferences are\\nassumed to be such that between\\nany two bundles ( x1, x2) and ( y1, y2),\\nif (x1, x2) has more of at least one of\\nthe goods and no less of the other\\ngood compared to ( y1, y2), then the\\nconsumer prefers ( x1, x2) to ( y1, y2).\\nPreferences of this kind are called\\nmonotonic preferences. Thus, a\\nconsumer’s preferences are\\nmonotonic if and only if between\\nany two bundles, the consumer\\nprefers the bundle which has more\\nof at least one of the goods and no\\nless of the other good as compared\\nto the other bundle.Indif ference Curve for per fect\\nsubstitutes.

But this is clearly an absurd result, as on point B, the consumer gets a\\ngreater number of mangoes with the same quantity of bananas. So consumer is\\nbetter off at point B than at point C. Thus, it is clear that intersecting indifference\\ncurves will lead to conflicting results. Thus, two indifference curves cannot\\nintersect each other .\\n2.2 T HE CONSUMER ’S BUDGET\\nLet us consider a consumer who has only a fixed amount of money (income) to\\nspend on two goods . The prices of  the goods  are given in the market. The consumer\\ncannot buy any and every combination of the two goods that she may want to\\nconsume. The consumption bundles that are available to the consumer depend\\non the prices of the two goods and the income of the consumer . Given her fixed\\nincome and the prices of the two goods , the consumer can a fford to buy only\\nthose bundles which cost her less  than or equal to her income.\\n2.2.1  Budget Set and Budget Line\\nSuppose the income of the consumer is M and the prices of bananas and mangoes\\nare p1 and p2 respectively5. If the consumer wants to buy x1 quantities of bananas,\\nshe will have to spend p1x1 amount of money. Similarly, if the consumer wants\\nto buy x2 quantities of mangoes, she will have to spend p2x2 amount of money.\\nTherefore, if the consumer wants to buy the bundle consisting of x1 quantities of\\nbananas and x2 quantities of mangoes, she will have to spend p1x1 + p2x2 amount\\nof money. She can buy this bundle only if she has at least p1x1 + p2x2 amount of\\nmoney. Given the prices of the goods and the income of a consumer , she can\\nchoose any bundle as long as it costs less than or equal to the income she has.\\nIn other words, the consumer can buy any bundle ( x1, x2) such that\\np1x1 + p2x2 ≤ M     (2.1)\\nThe inequality (2.1) is called the consumer’s budget constraint . The set of\\nbundles available to the consumer is called the budget set . The budget set is\\nthus the collection of all bundles that the consumer can buy with her income at\\nthe prevailing market prices.\\nEXAMPLE  2.1\\nConsider , for example, a consumer who has Rs 20, and suppose, both the goods\\nare priced at Rs 5 and are available only in integral units. The bundles that this\\nconsumer can afford to buy are: (0, 0), (0, 1), (0, 2), (0, 3), (0, 4), (1, 0), (1, 1),\\n(1, 2), (1, 3), (2, 0), (2, 1), (2, 2), (3, 0), (3, 1) and (4, 0). Among these bundles,\\n(0, 4), (1,3), (2, 2), (3, 1) and (4, 0) cost exactly Rs 20 and all the other bundles\\ncost less than Rs 20. The consumer cannot afford to buy bundles like (3, 3) and\\n(4, 5) because they cost more than Rs 20 at the prevailing prices.\\n5Price of a good is the amount of money that the consumer has to pay per unit of the good she\\nwants to buy. If rupee is the unit of money and quantity of the good is measured in kilograms, the\\nprice of banana being p1 means the consumer has to pay p1 rupees per kilograms of banana that she\\nwants to buy.\\nReprint 2024-25\\n16Introductory\\nMicroeconomicsIf both the goods are perfectly\\ndivisible6, the consumer’s budget set\\nwould consist of all bundles ( x1, x2)\\nsuch that x1 and x2 are any numbers\\ngreater than or equal to 0 and p1x1 +\\np2x2 ≤ M. The budget set can be\\nrepresented in a diagram as in Figure\\n2.9.\\nAll bundles in the positive\\nquadrant which are on or below the\\nline are included in the budget set.\\nThe equation of the line is\\np1x1 + p2x2 = M (2.2)\\nThe line consists of all bundles which\\ncost exactly equal to M. This line is\\ncalled the budget line. Points below\\nthe budget line represent bundles\\nwhich cost strictly less than M.\\nThe equation (2.2) can also be written as7\\n1\\n2 1\\n2 2p Mx xp p= − (2.3)\\nThe budget line is a straight line with horizontal intercept \\n1M\\np and vertical\\nintercept \\n2M\\np. The horizontal intercept represents the bundle that the consumer\\ncan buy if she spends her entire income on bananas. Similarly, the vertical\\nintercept represents the bundle that the consumer can buy if she spends her\\nentire income on mangoes. The slope of the budget line is  1\\n2–p\\np.\\nPrice Ratio and the Slope of the Budget Line\\nThink of any point on the budget line. Such a point represents a bundle which\\ncosts the consumer her entire budget. Now suppose the consumer wants to\\nhave one more banana. She can do it only if she gives up some amount of the\\nother good. How many mangoes does she have to give up if she wants to have an\\nextra quantity of bananas? It would depend on the prices of the two goods. A\\nquantity of banana costs p1. Therefore,  she will have to reduce her expenditure\\non mangoes by p1 amount, if she wants one more quantity of banana. With p1,\\nshe could buy 1\\n2p\\np quantities of mangoes. Therefore, if the consumer wants to\\nhave an extra quantity of bananas when she is spending all her money, she will\\nhave to give up 1\\n2p\\npquantities of mangoes. In other words, in the given market\\n6The goods considered in Example 2.1 were not divisible and were available only in integer units.\\nThere are many goods which are divisible in the sense that they are available in non-integer units\\nalso. It is not possible to buy half an orange or one-fourth of a banana, but it is certainly possible to\\nbuy half a kilogram of rice or one-fourth of a litre of milk.\\n7In school mathematics, you have learnt the equation of a straight line as y = c + mx where c is the\\nvertical intercept and m is the  slope of the straight line. Note that equation (2.3) has the same form.Budget Set . Quantity of bananas is measured\\nalong the horizontal axis and quantity of mangoes\\nis measured along the vertical axis.

When the price of either of the goods or the consumer’s income\\nchanges , the set of available bundles is also likely to change. Suppose the\\nconsumer’s income changes from M to M′ but the prices of the two goods remain\\nunchanged. With the new income, the consumer can afford to buy all bundles\\n(x1, x2) such that p1x1 + p2x2 ≤ M′. Now the equation of the budget line is\\np1x1 + p2x2 = M′ (2.8)\\nEquation (2.8) can also be written as\\n1\\n2 1\\n2 2–p M'x xp p= (2.9)\\nNote that the slope of the new budget line is the same as the slope of the\\nbudget line prior to the change in the consumer’s income. However , the vertical\\nintercept has changed after the change in income. If there is an increase in the\\n8The absolute value of a number x is equal to x if x ≥ 0 and is equal to –  x if x < 0.

If the income increases, the\\nconsumer can buy more of the goods at the prevailing market prices. Similarly,\\nif the income goes down, i.e. if M' < M , both intercepts decrease, and hence, there\\nis a parallel inward shift of the budget line. If income goes down, the availability\\nof goods goes down. Changes in the set of available bundles resulting from\\nchanges in consumer’s income when the prices of the two goods remain\\nunchanged are shown in Figure 2.10.\\nNow suppose the price of bananas change from p1 to p'1 but the price of\\nmangoes and the consumer’s income remain unchanged. At the new price of\\nbananas, the consumer can afford to buy all bundles ( x1,x2) such that p'1x1 +\\np2x2 ≤ M. The equation of the budget line is\\np'1x1 + p2x2 = M (2.10)\\nEquation (2.10) can also be written as\\n1\\n1\\n2 2–2p' Mx xp p= (2.11)\\nNote that the vertical intercept of the new budget line is the same as the\\nvertical intercept of the budget line prior to the change in the price of bananas .\\nHowever , the slope of the budget line and horizontal inter cept have changed\\nafter the price change. If the price of bananas  increases, ie  if p'1> p1, the absolute\\nvalue of the slope of the budget line increases , and the budget line becomes\\nsteeper (it pivots inwards around the vertical intercept  and horizontal intercept\\ndecreases ). If the price of bananas  decreases,  i.e., p'1< p1, the absolute value of\\nthe slope of the budget line decreases and hence , the budget line becomes\\nflatter (it pivots outwards around the vertical intercept  and horizontal intercept\\nincreases ). Figure 2. 11 shows change in the budget set when the price of only one\\ncommodity changes while the price of the other commodity as well as income of\\nthe consumer are constant.\\nA change in price of mangoes, when price of bananas and the consumer’s\\nincome remain unchanged, will bring about similar changes in the budget set of\\nthe consumer .Changes in the Set of Available Bundles of Goods Resulting from Changes in the\\nConsumer’s Income .

The\\nconsumer can choose her consumption bundle from the budget set. But on\\nwhat basis does she choose her consumption bundle from the ones that are\\navailable to her? In economics, it is assumed that the consumer chooses her\\nconsumption bundle on the basis of her  tatse and preferences over  the bundles\\nin the budget set. It is generally assumed that the consumer has well defined\\npreferences over the set of all possible bundles. She can compare any two\\nbundles. In other words, between any two bundles, she either prefers one to the\\nother or she is indifferent between the two.\\nMangoes\\nBananasMangoes\\nBananas\\n11\\nChanges in the Set of Available Bundles of Goods Resulting from Changes in the\\nPrice of bananas . An increase in the price of bananas makes the budget line steeper as in\\npanel (a). A decrease in the price of bananas makes the budget line flatter as in panel (b).\\nEquality of the Marginal Rate of Substitution and the Ratio of\\nthe Prices\\nThe optimum bundle of the consumer is located at the point where the\\nbudget line is tangent to one of the indifference curves. If the budget line\\nis tangent to an indifference curve at a point , the absolute value of the\\nslope of the indifference curve (MRS) and that of the budget line (price\\nratio) are same at that point. Recall from our earlier discussion that the\\nslope of the indifference curve is the rate at which the consumer is willing\\nto substitute one good for the other . The slope of the budget line is the\\nrate at which the consumer is able to substitute one good for the other\\nin the market. At the optimum , the two rates should be the same. To see\\nwhy, consider a point where this is not so. Suppose the MRS at such a\\npoint is 2 and suppose the two goods have the same price. At this point ,\\nthe consumer is willing to give up 2 mangoes  if she is given an extra\\nbanana . But in the market , she can buy an extra banana  if she gives up\\njust 1 mango . Therefore, if she buys an extra banana, she can have more\\nof both the goods compared to the bundle represented by the point, and\\nhence,  move to a preferred bundle. Thus , a point at which the MRS is\\ngreater , the price ratio cannot be the optimum. A similar ar gument holds\\nfor any point at which the MRS is less than the price ratio.\\nReprint 2024-25\\n20Introductory\\nMicroeconomicsIn economics, it is generally assumed that the consumer is a rational\\nindividual. A rational individual clearly knows what is good or what is bad for\\nher, and in any given situation, she always tries to achieve the best for herself.\\nThus, not only does a consumer have well-defined preferences over the set of\\navailable bundles, she also acts according to her preferences. From the bundles\\nwhich ar e available to her , a rational consumer always chooses the one which\\ngives her maximum satisfaction.\\nIn the earlier sections, it was observed that the budget set describes the\\nbundles that are available to the consumer and her preferences over the available\\nbundles can usually be represented by an indifference map. Therefore, the\\nconsumer’s problem can also be stated as follows: The rational consumer’s\\nproblem is to move to a point on the highest possible indifference curve given\\nher budget set.\\nIf such a point exists, where would it be located?  The optimum point  would\\nbe located on the budget line. A point below the budget line cannot be the\\noptimum. Compared to a point below the budget line, there is always some\\npoint on the budget line which contains more of at least one of the goods and\\nno less of the other , and is , therefore, preferred by a consumer whose pr eferences\\nare monotonic. Therefore, if the consumer’s preferences are monotonic, for any\\npoint below the budget line, there is some point on the budget line which is\\npreferred by the consumer . Points above the budget line ar e not available to\\nthe consumer . Ther efore, the optimum (most pr eferred) bundle of the consumer\\nwould be on the budget line.\\nWhere on the budget line will the optimum bundle be located? The point at\\nwhich the budget line just touches (is tangent to) , one of the indifference curves\\nwould be the optimum.9 To see why this is so, note that any point on the budget\\nline other than the point at which it touches the indif ference curve lies on a\\nlower indif ference curve and hence is inferior . Ther efore, such a point cannot be\\nthe consumer’s optimum. The optimum bundle is located on the budget line at\\nthe point where the budget line is tangent to an indifference curve.\\nFigure 2.12 illustrates the\\nconsumer’s optimum. At * *\\n1 2( , )x x , the\\nbudget line is tangent to the black\\ncoloured indifference curve. The first\\nthing to note is that the indifference\\ncurve just touching the budget line\\nis the highest possible indifference\\ncurve given the consumer’s budget\\nset. Bundles on the indifference\\ncurves above this, like the grey one,\\nare not affordable. Points on the\\nindifference curves below this, like the\\nblue one, are certainly inferior to the\\npoints on the indifference curve, just\\ntouching the budget line. Any other\\npoint on the budget line lies on a lower indifference curve and hence, is inferior\\nto * *\\n1 2( , )x x . Therefore, * *\\n1 2( , )x x  is the consumer’s optimum bundle.\\n9 To be more precise, if the situation is as depicted in Figure 2.12 then the optimum would be\\nlocated at the point wher e the budget line is tangent to one of the indif ference curves. However ,\\nthere are other situations in which the optimum is at a point where the consumer spends her entire\\nincome on one of the goods only.Consumer’s Optimum.

It was observed that the amount of a\\ngood that the consumer chooses optimally, depends on the price of the good\\nitself, the prices of other goods, the consumer’s income and her tastes and\\npreferences. The quantity of a commodity that a consumer is willing to buy and\\nis able to afford, given prices of goods and consumer’s tastes and preferences is\\ncalled demand  for the commodity. Whenever one or more of these variables\\nchange, the quantity of the good chosen\\nby the consumer is likely to change as\\nwell. Here we shall change one of these\\nvariables at a time and study how the\\namount of the good chosen by the\\nconsumer is related to that variable.\\n2.4.1  Demand Curve and the Law of\\nDemand\\nIf the prices of other goods, the\\nconsumer’s income and her tastes and\\npreferences remain unchanged, the\\namount of a good that the consumer\\noptimally chooses, becomes entirely\\ndependent on its price. The relation\\nbetween the consumer’s optimal choice\\nof the quantity of a good and its price is\\nvery important and this relation is called\\nthe demand function . Thus, the\\nconsumer’s demand function for a good\\nFunctions\\nConsider any two variables x and y. A function\\ny = f(x)\\nis a relation between the two variables x and y such that for each value of x,\\nthere is an unique value of the variable y. In other words, f(x) is a rule\\nwhich assigns an unique value y for each value of x. As the value of y\\ndepends on the value of x, y is called the dependent variable and x is called\\nthe independent variable.\\nEXAMPLE  1\\nConsider , for example, a situation wher e x can take the values 0, 1, 2, 3 and\\nsuppose corresponding values of y are 10, 15, 18 and 20, respectively.\\nHere y and x are related by the function y = f(x) which is defined as follows:\\nf(0) = 10 ; f(1) = 15 ; f(2) = 18 and f(3) = 20.\\nEXAMPLE  2\\nConsider another situation where x can take the values 0, 5, 10 and 20.\\nAnd suppose corresponding values of y are 100, 90, 70 and 40, respectively.Demand Curve . The demand curve is a\\nrelation between the quantity of the good\\nchosen by a consumer and the price of the\\ngood. The independent variable (price) is\\nmeasured along the vertical axis and\\ndependent variable (quantity) is measured\\nalong the horizontal axis. The demand curve\\ngives the quantity demanded by the\\nconsumer at each price.\\nReprint 2024-25\\n22Introductory\\nMicroeconomics\\nHere, y and x are related by the function y = f(x) which is defined as follows:\\nf(0) = 100;  f(10) = 90;  f(15) = 70 and f(20) = 40.\\nVery often a functional r elation between the two variables can be expr essed\\nin algebraic form like\\ny = 5 + x and y = 50 – x\\nA function y = f(x) is an increasing function if the value of y does not\\ndecrease with increase in the value of x. It is a decreasing function if the\\nvalue of y does not increase with increase in the value of x. The function in\\nExample 1 is an increasing function. So is the function y = x + 5. The function\\nin Example 2 is a decreasing function. The function y = 50 – x is also\\ndecreasing.\\nGraphical Representation of a Function\\nA graph of a function y = f(x) is a diagrammatic representation of\\nthe function. Following are the graphs of the functions in the examples\\ngiven above.\\nUsually, in a graph, the independent variable is measured along the\\nhorizontal axis and the dependent variable is measured along the vertical\\naxis. However , in economics, often the opposite is done. The demand curve,\\nfor example, is drawn by taking the independent variable (price) along the\\nvertical axis and the dependent variable (quantity) along the horizontal axis.\\nThe graph of an increasing function is upward sloping or and the graph of a\\ndecreasing function is downward sloping. As we can see from the diagrams\\nabove, the graph of y = 5 + x is upward sloping and that of y = 50 –  x, is\\ndownward sloping.\\nReprint 2024-25\\n23Theory of Consumer\\nBehaviourgives the amount of the good that the consumer chooses at different levels of its\\nprice when the other things remain unchanged. The consumer’s demand for a\\ngood as a function of its price can be written as\\nX = f (P) (2.12)\\nwhere X  denotes the quantity and P  denotes the price of the good.\\nThe demand function can also be represented graphically as in Figure 2.13.\\nThe graphical representation of the demand function is called the demand curve .\\nThe relation between the consumer’s demand for a good and the price of the\\ngood is likely to be negative in general. In other words, the amount of a good\\nthat a consumer would optimally choose is likely to increase when the price of\\nthe good falls and it is likely to decrease with a rise in the price of the good.\\n2.4.2 Deriving a Demand Curve from Indifference Curves and Budget\\nConstraints\\nConsider an individual consuming bananas (X1)and mangoes (X2), whose income\\nis M and market prices of X1 and X2 are 1P'and 2P 'respectively. Figure (a) depicts\\nher consumption equilibrium at point C, where she buys 1X 'and 2X 'quantities\\nof bananas and mangoes respectively. In panel (b) of figure 2.14, we plot 1P '\\nagainst 1X ' which is the first point on the demand curve for X1.\\nSuppose the price of X1 drops to 1P with 2P ' and M remaining constant. The\\nbudget  set in panel (a), expands and new consumption equilibrium is on a\\nhigher indifference curve at point D, where she buys more of bananas ( >1 1X X ' ).\\nThus, demand for bananas increases as its price drops. We plot 1P against 1X\\nin panel (b) of figure 2.14 to get the second point on the demand curve for X1.\\nLikewise the price of bananas can be dropped further to ∧\\n1P, resulting in further\\nincrease in consumption of bananas to ∧\\n1X. ∧\\n1P plotted against ∧\\n1X gives us the\\nthird point on the demand curve. Therefore, we observe that a drop in price of\\nbananas results in an increase in quality of bananas purchased by an individual\\nwho maximises his utility. The demand curve for bananas is thus negatively\\nsloped.\\nThe negative slope of the demand curve can also be explained in terms of the\\ntwo effects namely, substitution effect and income effect  that come into play\\nwhen price of a commodity changes.  When bananas become cheaper, the\\nconsumer maximises his utility by substituting bananas for mangoes in order\\nto derive the same level of satisfaction of a price change , resulting in an increase\\nin demand for bananas.Deriving a demand curve from indifference curves and budget constraints\\nReprint 2024-25\\n24Introductory\\nMicroeconomicsMoreover, as price of bananas dr ops, consumer’s pur chasing power incr eases,\\nwhich further increases demand for bananas (and mangoes). This is the income\\neffect of a price change, resulting in further increase in demand for bananas.\\nLaw of Demand:  Law of Demand states that other things being equal,\\nthere is a negative relation between demand for a commodity and its price. In\\nother words, when price of the commodity increases, demand for it falls and\\nwhen price of the commodity decreases, demand for it rises, other factors\\nremaining the same.\\nLinear Demand\\nA linear demand curve can be written\\nas\\nd(p) = a – bp; 0 ≤ p ≤a\\nb\\n = 0; p > a\\nb               (2.13)\\nwhere a is the vertical intercept, –b is\\nthe slope of the demand curve. At\\nprice 0, the demand is a, and at price\\nequal to a\\nb, the demand is 0. The\\nslope of the demand curve measures\\nthe rate at which demand changes with respect to its price. For a unit increase\\nin the price of the good, the demand falls by b units. Figure 2.15 depicts a linear\\ndemand curve.\\n2.4.3  Normal and Inferior Goods\\nThe demand function is a relation between the consumer’s demand for a\\ngood and its price when other things are given. Instead of studying the relation\\nbetween the demand for a good and its price , we can also study the relation\\nbetween the consumer’s demand for the good and the income of the consumer .\\nThe quantity of a good that the\\nconsumer demands can increase or\\ndecrease with the rise in income\\ndepending on the nature of the good.\\nFor most goods , the quantity that a\\nconsumer chooses, increases as the\\nconsumer’s income increases and\\ndecreases as the consumer’s income\\ndecreases. Such goods are called\\nnormal goods . Thus , a consumer’s\\ndemand for a normal good moves in the\\nsame direction as the income of the\\nconsumer . However , ther e are some\\ngoods the demands for which move in\\nthe opposite direction of the income of\\nthe consumer . Such goods ar e called\\ninferior goods . As the income of the\\nconsumer increases , the demand for an\\ninferior good falls , and as the income\\ndecreases , the demand for an inferiorLinear Demand Curve.

But, beyond\\na level, any increase in income of the consumer is likely to reduce her\\nconsumption of such food items as she switches to better quality cereals.\\n2.4.4  Substitutes and Complements\\nWe can also study the r elation between the quantity of a good that a consumer\\nchooses and the price of a related good. The quantity of a good that the\\nconsumer chooses can increase or decrease with the rise in the price of a\\nrelated good depending on whether the two goods are substitutes  or\\ncomplementary  to each other . Goods which ar e consumed together ar e called\\ncomplementary goods. Examples of goods which are complement to each\\nother include tea and sugar , shoes and socks, pen and ink, etc. Since tea\\nand sugar are used together , an incr ease in the price of sugar is likely to\\ndecrease the demand for tea and a decrease in the price of sugar is likely to\\nincrease the demand for tea. Similar is the case with other complements. In\\ngeneral, the demand for a good moves in the opposite direction of the price of\\nits complementary goods.\\nIn contrast to complements, goods like tea and coffee are not consumed\\ntogether . In fact, they ar e substitutes for each other . Since tea is a substitute for\\ncoffee, if the price of coffee increases, the consumers can shift to tea, and hence,\\nthe consumption of tea is likely to go up. On the other hand, if the price of coffee\\ndecreases, the consumption of tea is likely to go down. The demand for a good\\nusually moves in the direction of the price of its substitutes.\\n2.4.5  Shifts in the Demand Curve\\nThe demand curve was drawn under the assumption that the consumer’s\\nincome, the prices of other goods and the preferences of the consumer are given.\\nWhat happens to the demand curve when any of these things changes?\\nGiven the prices of other goods and the pr eferences of a consumer , if the\\nincome increases, the demand for the good at each price changes, and hence,\\nthere is a shift in the demand curve. For normal goods, the demand curve shifts\\nrightward and for inferior goods, the demand curve shifts leftward.\\nGiven the consumer’s income and her preferences, if the price of a related\\ngood changes , the demand for a good at each level of its price changes , and\\nhence,  there is a shift in the demand curve. If there is an increase in the price of\\na substitute good , the demand curve shifts rightward. On the other hand , if\\nthere is an increase in the price of a complementary good , the demand curve\\nshifts leftward.\\nThe demand curve can also shift due to a change in the tastes and preferences\\nof the consumer . If the consumer’s pr eferences change in favour of a good, the\\ndemand curve for such a good shifts rightward. On the other hand, the demand\\ncurve shifts leftward due to an unfavourable change in the preferences of the\\nconsumer . The demand curve for ice-cr eams, for example, is likely to shift\\nrightward in the summer because of preference for ice-creams goes up in\\nsummer . Revelation of the fact that cold-drinks might be injurious to health can\\nadversely affect preferences for cold-drinks. This is likely to result in a leftward\\nshift in the demand curve for cold- drinks.\\nReprint 2024-25\\n26Introductory\\nMicroeconomics\\n2.5 M ARKET D EMAND\\nIn the last section, we studied the choice problem of the individual consumer\\nand derived the demand curve of the consumer . However , in the market for aShifts in the demand curve are depicted in Figure 2.16. It may be mentioned\\nthat shift in demand curve takes place when ther e is a change in some factor ,\\nother than the price of the commodity.\\n2.4.6 Movements along the Demand Curve and Shifts in the\\nDemand Curve\\nAs it has been noted earlier , the amount of a good that the consumer chooses\\ndepends on the price of the good, the prices of other goods, income of the\\nconsumer and her tastes and preferences. The demand function is a relation\\nbetween the amount of the good and its price when  other things remain\\nunchanged. The demand curve is a graphical representation of the demand\\nfunction. At higher prices , the demand is less , and at lower prices , the demand\\nis more. Thus , any change in the price leads to movements along the demand\\ncurve. On the other hand, changes in any of the other things lead to a shift in\\nthe demand curve. Figure 2.17  illustrates a movement along the demand\\ncurve and a shift in the demand curve.Shifts in Demand . The demand curve in panel (a) shifts leftward and that in panel\\n(b) shifts rightward.\\nMovement along a Demand Curve and Shift of a Demand Curve . Panel (a) depicts a\\nmovement along the demand curve and panel (b) depicts a shift of the demand curve.\\nReprint 2024-25\\n27Theory of Consumer\\nBehaviourgood, there are many consumers. It is important to find out the market demand\\nfor the good. The market demand for a good at a particular price is the total\\ndemand of all consumers taken together . The market demand for a good can be\\nderived from the individual demand curves. Suppose there are only two\\nconsumers in the market for a good. Suppose at price p′, the demand of consumer\\n1 is q′1 and that of consumer 2 is q′2. Then, the market demand of the good at p′\\nis q′1 + q′2. Similarly, at price ˆp, if the demand of consumer 1 is 1ˆq and that of\\nconsumer 2 is 2ˆq, the market demand of the good at ˆp is 1 2ˆ ˆq q+. Thus, the\\nmarket demand for the good at each price can be derived by adding up the\\ndemands of the two consumers at that price. If there are more than two consumers\\nin the market for a good, the market demand can be derived similarly.\\nThe market demand curve of a good can also be derived from the individual\\ndemand curves graphically by adding up the individual demand curves\\nhorizontally as shown in Figure 2.18. This method of adding two curves is called\\nhorizontal summation.\\nAdding up T wo Linear Demand Curves\\nConsider , for example, a market wher e ther e are two consumers and the demand\\ncurves of the two consumers are given as\\nd1(p) = 10 – p (2.14)\\nand d2(p) = 15 – p (2.15)\\nFurthermore, at any price greater than 10, the consumer 1 demands 0 unit of\\nthe good, and similarly, at any price greater than 15, the consumer 2 demands 0\\nunit of the good. The market demand can be derived by adding equations (2.1 4)\\nand (2.1 5). At any price less than or equal to 10, the market demand is given by\\n25 – 2p, for any price greater than 10, and less than or equal to 15, market\\ndemand is 15 – p, and at any price greater than 15, the market demand is 0.\\n2.6 E LASTICITY  OF DEMAND\\nThe demand for a good moves in the opposite direction of its price. But the\\nimpact of the price change is always not the same. Sometimes, the demand for a\\ngood changes considerably even for small price changes. On the other hand,\\nthere are some goods for which the demand is not affected much by price changes.Derivation of the Market Demand Curve . The market demand curve can be derived as\\na horizontal summation of the individual demand curves.\\nReprint 2024-25\\n28Introductory\\nMicroeconomicsDemands for some goods are very responsive to price changes while demands\\nfor certain others are not so responsive to price changes. Price elasticity of demand\\nis a measure of the responsiveness of the demand for a good to changes in its\\nprice. Price elasticity of demand for a good is defined as the percentage change\\nin demand for the good divided by the percentage change in its price. Price-\\nelasticity of demand for a good\\neD = percentage change in demand for the good\\npercentage change in the price of the good(2.16a)\\n100\\n100Q\\nQ\\nP\\nP\\nQ P\\nQ P∆×\\n=∆×\\n∆ \\uf8eb \\uf8f6 \\uf8eb \\uf8f6= × \\uf8ec \\uf8f7 \\uf8ec \\uf8f7∆\\uf8ed \\uf8f8 \\uf8ed \\uf8f8(2.16b)\\nWhere, P∆ is the change in price of the good and Q∆is the change in quantity\\nof the good.\\nEXAMPLE  2.2\\nSuppose an individual buy 15 bananas when its price is Rs. 5 per banana. when\\nthe price increases to Rs. 7 per banana, she reduces his demand to 12 bananas.\\nIn order to find her elasticity demand for bananas, we find the percentage change\\nin quantity demanded and its price, using the information summarized in table.\\nNote that the price elasticity of demand is a negative number since the demand\\nfor a good is negatively r elated to the price of a good. However , for simplicity, we\\nwill always refer to the absolute value of the elasticity.\\nPercentage change in quantity demanded = \\n1100Q\\nQ∆×\\n     = 2 1\\n1100Q Q\\nQ\\uf8eb \\uf8f6 −× \\uf8ec \\uf8f7\\n\\uf8ed \\uf8f8\\n     12 15100 2015−= × = −\\nPercentage change in Market price = \\n1100P\\nP∆×\\n      = 2 1\\n1100P P\\nP\\uf8eb \\uf8f6 −× \\uf8ec \\uf8f7\\n\\uf8ed \\uf8f8\\n      7 5100 405−= × =Price Per banana (Rs.) : P     Quantity of bananas demanded : Q\\nOld Price : P1 = 5 Old quantity : Q1 = 15\\nNew Price : P2 = 7 New quantity: Q2 = 12\\nReprint 2024-25\\n29Theory of Consumer\\nBehaviourTherefore, in our example, as price of bananas increases by 40 percent,\\ndemand for bananas drops by 20 percent. Price elasticity of demand = =200.540De .\\nClearly, the demand for bananas is not very responsive to a change in price of\\nbananas. When the percentage change in quantity demanded is less than the\\npercentage change in market price, De is estimated to be less than one and the\\ndemand for the good is said to be inelastic at that price. Demand for essential\\ngoods is often found to be inelastic.\\nWhen the percentage change in quantity demanded is more than the\\npercentage change in market price, the demand is said to be highly responsive\\nto changes in market price and the estimated De is more than one. The demand\\nfor the good is said to be elastic at that price. Demand for luxury goods is seen\\nto be highly responsive to changes in their market prices and De>1.\\nWhen the percentage change in quantity demanded equals the percentage\\nchange in its market price, De is estimated to be equal to one and the demand\\nfor the good is said to be Unitary-elastic at that price. Note that the demand for\\ncertain goods may be elastic, unitary elastic and inelastic at different prices. In\\nfact, in the next section, elasticity along a linear demand curve is estimated at\\ndifferent prices and shown to vary at each point on a downward sloping demand\\ncurve.\\n2.6.1  Elasticity along a Linear Demand Curve\\nLet us consider a linear demand curve q = a – bp . Note that at any point on the\\ndemand curve, the change in demand per unit change in the price q\\np∆\\n∆ = –b.\\nSubstituting the value of q\\np∆\\n∆ in (2.16b),\\nwe obtain,  eD = – bp\\nq\\nputing the value of q,\\n       eD = – –bp\\na bp                       (2.17)\\nFrom (2.17), it is clear that the\\nelasticity of demand is different at\\ndifferent points on a linear demand\\ncurve. At p = 0, the elasticity is 0, at q =\\n0, elasticity is ∞. At p = 2a\\nb, the elasticity\\nis 1, at any price greater than 0 and less\\nthan 2a\\nb, elasticity is less than 1, and at any price greater than 2a\\nb, elasticity is\\ngreater than 1. The price elasticities of demand along the linear demand curve\\ngiven by equation (2.17) are depicted in Figure 2.19.Elasticity along a Linear Demand\\nCurve . Price elasticity of demand is different\\nat different points on the linear demand\\ncurve.\\nReprint 2024-25\\n30Introductory\\nMicroeconomics\\nConstant Elasticity Demand Curve\\nThe elasticity of demand on different points on a linear demand curve is different\\nvarying from 0 to ∞. But sometimes, the demand curves can be such that the\\nelasticity of demand r emains constant thr oughout. Consider , for example, a\\nvertical demand curve as the one depicted in Figure 2.20(a). Whatever be the\\nprice, the demand is given at the level q  . A price never leads to a change in the\\ndemand for such a demand curve and |eD| is always 0. Therefore, a vertical\\ndemand curve is perfectly inelastic.\\nFigure 2.20 (b) depics a horizontal demand curve, where market price\\nremains constant at P, whatever be the level of demand for the commodity. At\\nany other price, quantity demanded drops to zero and therefore de= ∞. A\\nhorizontal demand curve is perfectly elastic.\\nGeometric Measure of Elasticity along a Linear Demand Curve\\nThe elasticity of a linear demand\\ncurve can easily be measured\\ngeometrically. The elasticity of\\ndemand at any point on a straight\\nline demand curve is given by the\\nratio of the lower segment and the\\nupper segment of the demand curve\\nat that point. To see why this is the\\ncase, consider the following figure\\nwhich depicts a straight line\\ndemand curve, q = a – bp .\\nSuppose at price p0, the\\ndemand for the good is q0. Now\\nconsider a small change in the price. The new price is p1, and at that price,\\ndemand for the good is q1.\\n∆q = q1q0 = CD and ∆p = p1p0 = CE.\\nTherefore, eD = 0\\n0/\\n/q q\\np p∆\\n∆ = ∆\\n∆q\\np × 0\\n0p\\nq = 1 0\\n1 0q q\\np p × 0\\n0Op\\nOq = CD\\nCE × 0\\n0Op\\nOq\\nSince ECD and Bp0D are similar triangles, CD\\nCE = 0\\n0p D\\np B. But 0\\n0p D\\np B = o\\noOq\\np B\\neD = 0\\n0op\\nP B = 0\\n0q D\\nP B.\\nSince, Bp0D and BOA are similar triangles, 0\\n0q D\\np B = DA\\nDB\\nThus, eD = DA\\nDB.\\nThe elasticity of demand at different points on a straight line demand\\ncurve can be derived by this method. Elasticity is 0 at the point where the\\ndemand curve meets the horizontal axis and it is ∝ at the point where the\\ndemand curve meets the vertical axis. At the midpoint of the demand curve,\\nthe elasticity is 1, at any point to the left of the midpoint, it is greater than 1\\nand at any point to the right, it is less than 1.\\nNote that along the horizontal axis p = 0, along the vertical axis q = 0 and\\nat the midpoint of the demand curve p = 2a\\nb.\\nReprint 2024-25\\n31Theory of Consumer\\nBehaviourFigure 2.20(c) depicts a demand curve which has the shape of a rectangular\\nhyperbola. This demand curve has a property that a percentage change in price\\nalong the demand curve always leads to equal percentage change in quantity.\\nTherefore, |eD| = 1 at every point on this demand curve. This demand curve is\\ncalled the unitary elastic demand curve.\\n2.6.2  Factors Determining Price Elasticity of Demand for a Good\\nThe price elasticity of demand for a good depends on the nature of the good and\\nthe availability of close substitutes of the good. Consider , for example, necessities\\nlike food. Such goods are essential for life and the demands for such goods do\\nnot change much in response to changes in their prices. Demand for food does\\nnot change much even if food prices go up. On the other hand, demand for\\nluxuries can be very responsive to price changes. In general, demand for a\\nnecessity is likely to be price inelastic while demand for a luxury good is likely\\nto be price elastic.\\nThough demand for food is inelastic, the demands for specific food items are\\nlikely to be more elastic. For example, think of a particular variety of pulses. If the\\nprice of this variety of pulses goes up,  people can shift to some other variety of\\npulses which is a close substitute. The demand for a good is likely to be elastic if\\nclose substitutes are easily available. On the other hand, if close substitutes are\\nnot available easily,  the demand for a good is likely to be inelastic.\\n2.6.3  Elasticity and Expenditure\\nThe expenditure on a good is equal to the demand for the good times its price.\\nOften it is important to know how the expenditure on a good changes as a result\\nof a price change. The price of a good and the demand for the good are inversely\\nrelated to each other . Whether the expenditur e on the good goes up or down as\\na result of an increase in its price depends on how responsive the demand for\\nthe good is to the price change.\\nConsider an increase in the price of a good. If the percentage decline in\\nquantity is greater than the percentage increase in the price, the expenditure on\\nthe good will go down. For example, see row 2 in table 2.5 which shows that as\\nprice of a commodity increases by 10%, its demand drops by 12%, resulting in\\na decline in expenditure on the good. On the other hand, if the percentage decline\\nin quantity is less than the percentage increase in the price, the expenditure onConstant Elasticity Demand Curves . Elasticity of demand at all points along the vertical\\ndemand curve, as shown in panel (a), is 0. Elasticity of demand at all point along the\\nhorizontal demand curve, as shown in panel (b) is ∞. Elasticity at all points on the demand\\ncurve in panel (c) is 1.\\nReprint 2024-25\\n32Introductory\\nMicroeconomicsthe good will go up (See row 1 in table 2.5). And if the percentage decline in\\nquantity is equal to the percentage increase in the price, the expenditure on the\\ngood will remain unchanged (see row 3 in table 2.5).\\nNow consider a decline in the price of the good. If the percentage increase in\\nquantity is greater than the percentage decline in the price, the expenditure on\\nthe good will go up(see row 4 in table 2.5). On the other hand, if the percentage\\nincrease in quantity is less than the percentage decline in the price, the expenditure\\non the good will go down(see row 5 in table 2.5). And if the percentage increase\\nin quantity is equal to the percentage decline in the price, the expenditure on\\nthe good will remain unchanged (see row 6 in table 2.5).\\nThe expenditure on the good would change in the opposite direction as the\\nprice change if and only if the percentage change in quantity is greater than the\\npercentage change in price, ie if the good is price-elastic (see rows 2 and 4 in\\ntable 2.5). The expenditure on the good would change in the same direction as\\nthe price change if and only if the percentage change in quantity is less than the\\npercentage change in price, i.e., if the good is price inelastic (see rows 1 and 5 in\\ntable 2.5). The expenditure on the good would remain unchanged if and only if\\nthe percentage change in quantity is equal to the percentage change in price,\\ni.e., if the good is unit-elastic (see rows 3 and 6 in table 2.5).\\nChange   Change in     % Change   % Change       Impact on     Nature of price\\nin Price   Quantity      in price     in quantity Expenditure     Elasticity of\\n    (P)      demand (Q)   demand                              = P×Q           demandde\\n1        ↑              ↓                +10              -8                   ↑           Price Inelastic\\n2        ↑              ↓                +10            -12                  ↓             Price Elastic\\n3        ↑              ↓                +10            -10           No Change      Unit Elastic\\n4        ↓              ↑                -10             +15                 ↑             Price Elastic\\n5         ↓                 ↑                   -10                 +7                    ↓             Price Inelastic\\n6        ↓              ↑                 -10             +10         No Change     Unit ElasticTable 2.5: For hypothetic cases of price rise and drop, the following table\\nsummarises the relationship between elasticity and change in expenditure\\nof a commodity\\nRectangular Hyperbola\\nAn equation of the form\\nxy = c\\nwhere x and y are two variables and c is a\\nconstant, giving us a curve called\\nrectangular hyperbola.

People in the society need many goods and\\nservices1 in their everyday life including food, clothing, shelter ,\\ntransport facilities like roads and railways, postal services and\\nvarious other services like that of teachers and doctors. In fact, the\\nlist of goods and services that any individual2 needs is so large that\\nno individual in society, to begin with, has all the things she needs.\\nEvery individual has some amount of only a few of the goods and\\nservices that she would like to use. A family farm may own a plot of\\nland, some grains, farming implements, maybe a pair of bullocks\\nand also the labour services of the family members. A weaver may\\nhave some yarn, some cotton and other instruments required for\\nweaving cloth. The teacher in the local school has the skills required\\nto impart education to the students. Some others in society may\\nnot have any resource3 excepting their own labour services. Each of\\nthese decision making units can produce some goods or services\\nby using the resources that it has and use part of the produce to\\nobtain the many other goods and services which it needs. For\\nexample, the family farm can produce corn, use part of the produce\\nfor consumption purposes and procure clothing, housing and\\nvarious services in exchange for the rest of the produce. Similarly,\\nthe weaver can get the goods and services that she wants in exchange\\nfor the cloth she produces in her yarn. The teacher can earn some\\nmoney by teaching students in the school and use the money for\\nobtaining the goods and services that she wants. The labourer also\\ncan try to fulfill her needs by using whatever money she can earn by\\nworking for someone else. Each individual can thus use her\\nresources to fulfill her needs. It goes without saying that no\\nindividual has unlimited resources compared to her needs. The\\namount of corn that the family farm can produce is limited by the\\namount of resources it has, and hence, the amount of different goods\\n1By goods we means physical, tangible objects used to satisfy people’s wants and needs. The\\nterm ‘goods’ should be contrasted with the term ‘services’, which captures the intangible satisfaction\\nof wants and needs. As compared to food items and clothes, which are examples of goods, we can\\nthink of the tasks that doctors and teachers perform for us as examples of services.\\n2By individual, we mean an individual decision making unit. A decision making unit can be a\\nsingle person or a group like a household, a firm or any other organisation.\\n3By resource, we mean those goods and services which are used to produce other goods and\\nservices, e.g. land, labour, tools and machinery, etc.\\nReprint 2024-25\\n2Introductory Microeconomicsand services that it can procure in exchange of corn is also limited. As a result, the\\nfamily is forced to make a choice between the different goods and services that are\\navailable. It can have more of a good or service only by giving up some amounts of\\nother goods or services. For example, if the family wants to have a bigger house, it\\nmay have to give up the idea of having a few more acres of arable land. If it wants\\nmore and better education for the children, it may have to give up some of the\\nluxuries of life. The same is the case with all other individuals in society. Everyone\\nfaces scarcity of resources, and therefore, has to use the limited resources in the\\nbest possible way to fulfill her needs.\\nIn general, every individual in society is engaged in the production of some\\ngoods or services and she wants a combination of many goods and services not\\nall of which ar e produced by her . Needless to say that ther e has to be some\\ncompatibility between what people in society collectively want to have and what\\nthey produce4. For example, the total amount of corn produced by family farm\\nalong with other farming units in a society must match the total amount of corn\\nthat people in the society collectively want to consume. If people in the society\\ndo not want as much corn as the farming units are capable of producing\\ncollectively, a part of the resources of these units could have been used in the\\nproduction of some other good or services which is in high demand. On the\\nother hand, if people in the society want more corn compared to what the farming\\nunits are producing collectively, the resources used in the production of some\\nother goods and services may be reallocated to the production of corn. Similar is\\nthe case with all other goods or services. Just as the resources of an individual\\nare scarce, the resources of the society are also scarce in comparison to what the\\npeople in the society might collectively want to have. The scarce resources of the\\nsociety have to be allocated properly in the production of different goods and\\nservices in keeping with the likes and dislikes of the people of the society.\\nAny allocation5 of resources of the society would result in the production of a\\nparticular combination of  different goods and services. The goods and services\\nthus produced will have to be distributed among the individuals of the society.\\nThe allocation of the limited resources and the distribution of the final mix of goods\\nand services are two of the basic economic problems faced by the society.\\nIn reality, any economy is much more complex compared to the society\\ndiscussed above. In the light of what we have learnt about the society, let us now\\ndiscuss the fundamental concerns of the discipline of economics some of which\\nwe shall study throughout this book.\\n1.2 C ENTRAL  PROBLEMS  OF AN ECONOMY\\nProduction, exchange and consumption of goods and services are among the\\nbasic economic activities of life. In the course of these basic economic activities,\\nevery society has to face scarcity  of resources and it is the scarcity of resources\\nthat gives rise to the problem of choice . The scarce resources of an economy\\nhave competing usages. In other words, every society has to decide on how to\\nuse its scarce resources. The problems of an economy are very often summarised\\nas follows:\\n4Here we assume that all the goods and services produced in a society are consumed by the people\\nin the society and that there is no scope of getting anything from outside the society. In reality, this\\nis not true. However , the general point that is being made her e about the compatibility of pr oduction\\nand consumption of goods and services holds for any country or even for the entire world.\\n5By an allocation of the resources, we mean how much of which resource is devoted to the\\nproduction of each of the goods and services.\\nReprint 2024-25\\n3Introduction\\nWhat is produced and in what quantities?\\nEvery society must decide on how much of each of the many possible goods and\\nservices it will produce. Whether to produce more of food, clothing, housing or\\nto have more of luxury goods. Whether to have more agricultural goods or to\\nhave industrial products and services. Whether to use more resources in education\\nand health or to use more resources in building military services. Whether to\\nhave more of basic education or more of higher education. Whether to have\\nmore of consumption goods or to have investment goods (like machine) which\\nwill boost production and consumption tomorrow.\\nHow are these goods produced?\\nEvery society has to decide on how much of which of the resources to use in the\\nproduction of each of the different goods and services. Whether to use more\\nlabour or more machines. Which of the available technologies to adopt in the\\nproduction of each of the goods?\\nFor whom are these goods produced?\\nWho gets how much of the goods that are produced in the economy? How should\\nthe produce of the economy be distributed among the individuals in the economy?\\nWho gets more and who gets less? Whether or not to ensure a minimum amount\\nof consumption for everyone in the economy . Whether or not elementary education\\nand basic health services should be available freely for everyone in the economy .\\nThus, every economy faces the problem of allocating the scarce resources to\\nthe production of different possible goods and services and of distributing the\\nproduced goods and services among the individuals within the economy. The\\nallocation of scarce resources and the distribution of the final goods and\\nservices are the central problems of any economy.\\nProduction Possibility Frontier\\nJust as individuals face scarcity of resources, the resources of an economy\\nas a whole are always limited in comparison to what the people in the\\neconomy collectively want to have. The scarce resources have alternative\\nusages and every society has to decide on how much of each of the resources\\nto use in the production of different goods and services. In other words,\\nevery society has to determine how to allocate its scarce resources to different\\ngoods and services.\\nAn allocation of the scarce resource of the economy gives rise to a\\nparticular combination of  different goods and services. Given the total amount\\nof resources , it is possible to allocate the resources in many different ways\\nand, thereby achiev ing different mixes of all possible good s and services. The\\ncollection of all possible combinations of the goods and services that can be\\nproduced from a given amount of resources and a given stock of technological\\nknowledge is called the production possibility set  of the economy.\\nEXAMPLE  1\\nConsider an economy which\\ncan produce corn or cotton\\nby using its resources.\\nTable 1.1 gives some of the\\ncombinations of corn and\\ncotton that the economy can\\nproduce. When its resources\\nare fully utilised.Table1.1:  Production Possibilities\\nPossibilities Corn Cotton\\nA 0 10\\nB 1 9\\nC 2 7\\nD 3 4\\nE 4 0\\nReprint 2024-25\\n4Introductory Microeconomics\\nIf all the resources are used in the production of corn, the maximum\\namount of corn that can be produced is 4 units and if all resources are used\\nin the production of cotton, at the most, 10 units of cotton can be produced.\\nThe economy can also produce1 unit of corn and 9 units of cotton or 2 units\\nof corn and 7 units of cotton or 3 units of corn and 4 units of cotton. There\\ncan be many other possibilities. The f igure illustrates the production\\npossibilities of the economy. Any point on or below the curve represents a\\ncombination of corn and cotton that can be produced with the economy’s\\nresources. The curve gives the maximum amount of corn that can be produced\\nin the economy for any given amount of cotton and vice-versa. This curve is\\ncalled the production possibility\\nfrontier .\\nThe production possibility\\nfrontier  gives the combinations of\\ncorn and cotton that can be\\nproduced when the resources of the\\neconomy are fully utilised. Note\\nthat a point lying strictly below the\\nproduction possibility frontier\\nrepresents a combination of corn\\nand cotton that will be produced\\nwhen all or some of the resources\\nare either underemployed or are\\nutilised in a wasteful fashion.\\nIf more of the scarce resources are used in the production of corn,\\nless resources are available for the production of cotton and vice versa.\\nTherefore, if we want to have more of one of the goods, we will have less\\nof the other good. Thus, there is always a cost of having a little more of\\none good in term s of the amount of the other good that has to be forgone.\\nThis is known as the opportunity costa of an additional unit of the\\ngoods.\\nEvery economy has to choose one of the many possibilities that it has.\\nIn other words, one of the central problems of the economy is to choose\\nfrom one of the many production possibilities.\\naNote that the concept of opportunity cost is applicable to the individual as well as the\\nsociety. The concept is very important and is widely used in economics. Because of its\\nimportance in economics, sometimes, opportunity cost is also called the economic cost.\\n1.3 O RGANISATION  OF ECONOMIC  ACTIVITIES\\nBasic problems can be solved either by the free interaction of the individuals\\npursuing their own objectives as is done in the market or in a planned manner\\nby some central authority like the government.\\n1.3.1  The Centrally Planned Economy\\nIn a centrally planned economy, the government or the central authority plans\\nall the important activities in the economy. All important decisions regarding\\nproduction, exchange and consumption of goods and services are made by the\\ngovernment. The central authority may try to achieve a particular allocation of\\nresources and a consequent distribution of the final combination of goods and\\nservices which is thought to be desirable for society as a whole. For example, if it\\nis found that a good or service which is very important for the prosperity and\\nCotton\\nA\\nB\\nC\\nD\\nE\\nOCorn\\nReprint 2024-25\\n5Introductionwell-being of the economy as a whole, e.g. education or health service, is not\\nproduced in adequate amount by the individuals on their own, the government\\nmight try to induce the individuals to produce adequate amount of such a good\\nor service or , alter natively, the gover nment may itself decide to pr oduce the good\\nor service in question. In a different context, if some people in the economy get\\nso little a share of the final mix of goods and services produced in the economy\\nthat their survival is at stake, then the central authority may intervene and try\\nto achieve an equitable distribution of the final mix of goods and services.\\n1.3.2  The Market Economy\\nIn contrast to a centrally planned economy, in a market economy , all economic\\nactivities are organised through the market. A market , as studied in economics,\\nis an institution6 which organises the free interaction of individuals pursuing\\ntheir respective economic activities. In other words, a market is a set of\\narrangements where economic agents can freely exchange their endowments or\\nproducts with each other . It is important to note that the ter m ‘market’ as used\\nin economics is quite different from the common sense understanding of a\\nmarket. In particular , it has nothing as such to do with the marketplace as you\\nmight tend to think of. For buying and selling commodities, individuals may or\\nmay not meet each other in an actual physical location. Interaction between\\nbuyers and sellers can take place in a variety of situations such as a village-\\nchowk or a super bazaar in a city, or alternatively, buyers and sellers can interact\\nwith each other through telephone or internet and conduct the exchange of\\ncommodities. The arrangements which allow people to buy and sell commodities\\nfreely are the defining features of a market.\\nFor the smooth functioning of any system, it is imperative that there is\\ncoordination in the activities of the different constituent parts of the system.\\nOtherwise, ther e can be chaos. Y ou may wonder as to what ar e the for ces which\\nbring the coordination between the activities of millions of isolated individuals\\nin a market system.\\nIn a market system, all goods or services come with a price (which is mutually\\nagreed upon by the buyers and sellers) at which the exchanges take place. The\\nprice reflects, on an average, the society’s valuation of the good or service in\\nquestion. If the buyers demand more of a certain good, the price of that good\\nwill rise. This signals to the producers of that good that the society as a whole\\nwants more of that good than is currently being produced and the producers of\\nthe good, in their turn, are likely to increase their production. In this way, prices\\nof goods and services send important information to all the individuals across\\nthe market and help achieve coordination in a market system. Thus, in a market\\nsystem, the central problems regarding how much and what to produce are\\nsolved through the coordination of economic activities brought about by the\\nprice signals.\\nIn reality, all economies are mixed economies where some important\\ndecisions are taken by the government and the economic activities are by and\\nlarge conducted through the market. The only difference is in terms of the\\nextent of the role of the government in deciding the course of economic activities.\\nIn the United States of America, the role of the government is minimal. The\\nclosest example of a centrally planned economy is the China  for the major part\\nof the twentieth century. In India , since Independence, the government has\\nplayed a major r ole in planning economic activities. However , the r ole of the\\n6An institution is usually defined as an organisation with some purpose.\\nReprint 2024-25\\n6Introductory Microeconomicsgovernment in the Indian economy has been reduced considerably in the last\\ncouple of decades.\\n1.4  P OSITIVE  AND NORMATIVE  ECONOMICS\\nIt was mentioned earlier that in princip le there are more than one ways of\\nsolving the central problems of an economy. These different mechanisms in\\ngeneral are likely to give rise to different solutions to those problems, thereby\\nresulting in different allocations of the resources and also different distributions\\nof the final mix of goods and services produced in the economy. Therefore, it is\\nimportant to understand which of these alternative mechanisms is more\\ndesirable for the economy as a whole. In economics, we try to analyse the\\ndifferent mechanisms and figure out the outcomes which are likely to result\\nunder each of these mechanisms. W e also try to evaluate the mechanisms by\\nstudying how desirable the outcomes resulting from them are. Often a\\ndistinction is made between positive economic analysis  and normative\\neconomic analysis  depending on whether we are trying to figure out how a\\nparticular mechanism functions or we are trying to ev aluate it. In positive\\neconomic analysis, we study how the different mechanisms function, and in\\nnormative economics, we try to understand whether these mechanisms are\\ndesirable or not. However , this distinction between positive and nor mative\\neconomic analysis is not a very sharp one. The positive and the normative\\nissues involved in the study of the central economic problems are very closely\\nrelated to each other and a proper understanding of one is not possible in\\nisolation to the other .\\n1.5  M ICROECONOMICS  AND MACROECONOMICS\\nTraditionally, the subject matter of economics has been studied under two br oad\\nbranches: Microeconomics  and Macroeconomics . In microeconomics, we study\\nthe behaviour of individual economic agents in the markets for different goods\\nand services and try to figure out how prices and quantities of goods and services\\nare determined through the interaction of individuals in these markets. In\\nmacroeconomics, on the other hand, we try to get an understanding of the\\neconomy as a whole by focusing our attention on aggregate measures such as\\ntotal output, employment and aggregate price level. Here, we are interested in\\nfinding out how the levels of these aggregate measures are determined and how\\nthe levels of these aggregate measures change over time. Some of the important\\nquestions that are studied in macroeconomics are as follows: What is the level of\\ntotal output in the economy? How is the total output determined? How does the\\ntotal output grow over time? Are the resources of the economy (eg labour) fully\\nemployed? What are the reasons behind the unemployment of resources? Why\\ndo prices rise? Thus, instead of studying the different markets as is done in\\nmicroeconomics, in macroeconomics, we try to study the behaviour of aggregate\\nor macro measures of the performance of the economy.\\n1.6  P LAN OF THE BOOK\\nThis book is meant to introduce you to the basic ideas in microeconomics. In\\nthis book, we will focus on the behaviour of the individual consumers and\\nproducers of a single commodity and try to analyse how the price and the\\nquantity is determined in the market for a single commodity.
